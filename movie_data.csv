0,EN,-1018312192,good interpretation of the actors # good special effects # good story # best human character cesar action not prevail as importance good this movie shows that apes in their evolution became more human than human beings have regressed important is the phase between oppression and rebellion the awareness acquired through intelligence of their state of slaves it an excellent movie which contains a meaning very deep for all people of earth when people wake up from darkness imposed by unscrupulous and greedy individuals they will emanate the light of revolution the only negative note i feel to observe is the easier way apes destroy scientific centre windows it would be impossible to break down a bulletproof door or window i prefer realism to exaggeration ,9

3,EN,-836740088,gattaca refers to a fictional aerospace company whose space flights the film protagonist vincent played by ethan hawke dreams of joining unfortunately for him the film begins with the natural i e old fashioned birth of vincent compared to the genetically engineered birth of his brother and most of the rest it appears of this society set in the not too distant future this society has the technical knowledge to allow parents to select the genetic components for their offspring that optimize mental and physical factors and apparently most parents pick that route rather than the uncertainty of random genetic re combination thus we have a two tiered society between the genetically enriched and the natural births respectively called valids and in valids in the film and vincent as an in valid with a heart condition is relegated to menial jobs rendering his dream of going into space impossible vincent gets a janitor job at gattaca and the rest of the film is largely driven by his efforts to get on the space flight to saturn moon titan by passing himself off as a valid by using genetic markers purchased from a valid the film ominously depicts how practically everybody is being screened all the time by their genetic markers e g blood a strand of hair which renders the individual almost instantly recognizable as a valid or in valid gattaca is a science fiction film that has no weird aliens or deadly space rays but instead takes an intelligent thoughtful approach to a scientific issue that may be closer than we think some scientists have predicted that perhaps in several decades we might have the two tiered society envisioned in gattaca between those with the financial resources to pay for genetically enriched children and those who must opt for a random shuffling of the parental genes for that matter this film reminded me of aldous huxley brave new world in which i re read a few chapters prompted by seeing gattica in huxley book all children are genetically designed to fit into five castes the less numerous but superior alpha and beta castes rule over the more numerous but inferior three lower castes who are subjected to chemical interference to promote arrested development in intelligence and physical growth the allocation of the castes presumably promotes social stability so we have # brave new world genetic determinism which seems to be sort of a centrally planned variety # the genetic determinism feared by current futurists who worry about genetic enrichment being accessible only perhaps initially to the rich making for a caste not a class society based on the resulting unequal competition and # gattica portrayal of a genetically determined world which shows genetic engineering available to everyone but with some opting for natural children of course this allows the film to celebrate the human spirit and motivation of an in valid as he strives to achieve his ambition but these personality characteristics e g motivation risk acceptance would also be at least partially genetically determinable as well in the world envisioned by gattaca if these issues intrigue you or better worry you than gattaca is a film for you ,10
4,EN,148997333,admittedly i read one or two comments from the imdb just to get a feel for the film before viewing i felt confident with the cast list and excited by the comments on the film visually stunning images i also thought that i would be going to get nick cave melodic soundtrack to the film no chance what a lengthy two hour tedious amount of drivel that story could have been edited to one hour if it was not for the pretence of lingering images of shadows and so forth after two hours i was willing the assassination to take place the characters may have been given some depth but they were just plain boring the story meanders in a plot which does not build tension but instead just meanders along from one dark scene to another and as for the train robbery scene i have seen better masks in tim burton nightmare before christmas why is everybody brainwashed by this film ,3

8,EN,-639976942,iron man is the first feature to be made entirely by marvel a gamble which has paid off to the tune of over ### million worldwide so far for a non sequel from a fledgling company that is impressive and bodes well for marvel reboot of the incredible hulk due in june comic book films are big money spinners now but the success of a new series is predicated on the entertainment value of the central character and in this way hulk and tony stark have similar problems they just are not super enough iron man starts with an unnecessary flashback structure presumably to ensure some loud action in the first minute or two tony stark played with now familiar post rehab gusto by robert downey jnr is the embodiment of the capitalistic jingoistic american ideal he has become absurdly rich designing weapons and more significantly has no moral qualms whatsoever about the negative effects of his work stark is not a nice man except he is this potentially realistic and complex dualistic behaviour is lost in the film failure to choose sides leading us to the first of many problems what are we the audience supposed to think of tony stark he is presented as bright and brilliant a charming man of the people but also as a womaniser and a warlord this initial confusion is nothing compared to what happens later on after a brush with death and a subsequent escape which is accomplished in an ultra violent fashion he holds a hippie press conference and vows to stop making weapons for good this turnaround is simply too fast and as presented by downey jnr with his usual twinkly eyed glazed look has none of the power or angst we have come to expect from comic book origin stories his parents are not murdered before his eyes nor is his home world destroyed he comes across as a petulant child who is bored with his old toys instead of using his money to work for peace or help starving children he creates a powered battle suit and flies around the world blowing things up exactly how this is protecting the people he put in harm way is slightly beyond me and the hypocrisy of the double standard is appalling it is only when stark realises that shock horror his weapons might be used against american troops that he begins to examine his conscience do not get the wrong idea there is nothing particularly obnoxious about iron man the performances are light and breezy and the script is a cut about the blockbuster norm littered as it is with a particularly dry sense of humour the central performance from robert downey jnr is the film saving grace but also its achilles heel his presence is enjoyable on the one hand but in my opinion also detracts from the credibility of the whole endeavour you keep expecting him to wink to camera and finally admit it is some kind of extravagant saturday night live parody that jeff bridges is really being played by will ferrell and terrence howard is actually just a cardboard cutout i still do not get terrance howard i have yet to see him raise a palpable or even guessable emotion in his roles his face seems oddly expressionless and his voice almost unbearable he gets some good lines in this film but sounds like he reading them from an auto cue but i digress as once off summer entertainment this kind of self aware film making is bearable but i simply cannot see the film becoming a much loved classic in the future so what does the film have going for it the special effects are impressive with the integration of cg and live action especially so the set pieces when they come run the gamut from mundane to genuinely thrilling stark armoured escape from captivity is surprisingly dull while some of the later aerial combat sequences are exciting once again though the use of sfx has positive and negative effects particularly in relation to the ending the final confrontation has become a serious problem for the superhero film in days of yore special effects were difficult so typically the best the film had to offer was saved for the ending now every scene is liberally slathered with computer generated gunk the result is explosive fatigue a run of overpowering sequences which forgo actual affect for special effect a dozen astonishingly well rendered high octane scenes does not create a cumulative effect if the same level of frankly awe inspiring cg work is applied to the hero designing and dressing in his suit then what is left for the audience to look forward to what makes a special effect special these days the ending of iron man is another clunky computer aided brawl where narrative is suspended for minutes at a time while increasingly unrealistic pieces of metal and flesh beat on each other this moment is reminiscent of a dozen other recent movie resolutions from hellboy to the matrix revolutions all equally dull without vicarious involvement a sense that a character we can identify with is in danger it just amounts to so many polygons perhaps i have been a little harsh on iron man i cannot honestly say i was bored by the experience but i do feel its major mis steps are a symptom of a greater malaise at the heart of contemporary blockbuster cinema if however your cynicism has not quite reached the pathological degree mine has you could well have some fun with iron man robert downey jnr jeff bridges and gwyneth paltrow are amiable enough company even if the latter seems as though an errant puff of wind would shatter her into a million pieces and the director jon favreau keeps things moving at a reasonable pace stark character arc is minimal more of a character stroll really but his near trademarked delivery of pg ## witticisms should be enough to hold your attention just ,9
9,EN,-639976942,omg this movie had it all the effects the plot the action the predictable cameo from stan lee look for it note to self cameos are cool and i should be in all of my films what else can i say about a film that has raked in ### million over the last # days according to the radio station that i showered to this morning and thats darn impressive i remember getting a text message saying stay till after the credits and i am happy i did and for those who are probably reading this you know why robert downey jr no relation to morton downey jr has really delivered as opposed to mr pacino in ## minutes his stark is believable jeff bridge character is also believable ,10
10,EN,-639976942,sexist hey c mon she looked really good standing around at the end there really really good violent sure stark idea of a solution to a violent situation was just smarter cooler weapons but they worked man they worked it not wrong when you can smart target only the jerks iffy science maybe tony stark is just smarter than isaac newton ever think of that huh i mean did isaac build body armor noooooooo i do not think so i totally had fun at this movie but it ridiculous that people are calling this a thinking man superhero film those are some seriously low standards ask yourself how good would it have been without mr downey seriously would have been the slightest bit interesting without him be honest this was not a good film it was just a fun film ,10
11,EN,-936112617,unforgiven is such an amazing film first of all let me just say i am still pretty young so you will probably laugh at what i am about to say but i consider unforgiven to be clint eastwood best movie it truly a masterpiece and when you add morgan freeman and gene hackman into the mix you know it gonna be a good film i look at unforgiven simply as this a man who has turned away from a life of violence and he is looking to raise his kids and remember his wife who has passed away when a gentleman known as the schofield kid shows up and offers munny eastwood a chance to split the reward of a violent act he decides to go but only if he can bring his best friend ned freeman well in a dramatic turn of events munny is forced to once again become the man from his past who he swore he would never become again my favorite scene of the movie is when munny goes to see ned and tells him about what they will be doing and why when eastwood rides up on that horse and freeman sees him i get goosebumps i totally recommend unforgiven if you have never seen it ## of ## ,10
12,EN,-936112617,i never got what is so great about this movie at least other eastwood westerns could entertain even pale rider a pale hybrid of shane and high plains drifter was better than this entertainment wise whatever message of anti violence in the film made no impression on me john wayne final film the shootist was better at that with the last scene in the saloon where ron howard throws the gun away and john wayne nods in agreement and dies certainly the director of that movie don siegel were he still alive at the time would have done a better job with unforgiven as he had as director of earlier eastwood films it was only eastwood aging that allowed him to make this particular kind of western and with that aging came a consistent decline of quality in his output not that any of his movies are all that great to begin with none of them inspire not even this message western it needed a much more involving story to relay its message ,2
13,EN,888363545,the movie ran as if it were a series of highlight clips from an actual film representation of the fourth harry potter novel details were thrown in haphazardly if for no other reason than to bring a feeling of recognition from readers if the viewer had not read the book but only seen the previous two movies s he would not have understood the movie the screenwriters created no semblance complicated plot but rather the rather single minded story of the three tasks in the tri wizard tournament all new characters were hardly introduced and remained quite one dimensional which is unfortunate even old favorites got the shaft in this one there was no time for more than two short scenes with either malfoy no magical lessons and dobby the house elf was completely absent crouch never disappeared but his body was found dead the cinematics in this case were atrocious harry appears in dumbledore chambers in the scene immediately after discovering crouch body but then proceeds to tell him about his scar hurting and dreams rather than crouch discovery there was no magical map no late night encounters with moody no discussion of snape and karkaroff relationship nor of dumbledore trusting snape seeing as this relationship will rise to be the single most prominent issue in the entire series i was very disappointed to find it was ignored in favor of large and ineffective theatrics such as a hedge maze without any traps only shifting walls and evil roots an extremely obnoxious modernized yule ball and a pointlessly drawn out dragon chase scene dumbledore lines and the directing of his acting made him look like an old bumbling fool rather than the clever most powerful wizard on the planet the only person of whom voldemort is afraid the writers decided to add crouch jr into harry dreams completely removed the second house elf and the invisibility cloak from the quidditch world cup and had the audacity to explain that crouch jr had been sent to azkaban but never explained his escape finally the movie ended with crouch jr being sent back to azkaban the minister of magic never showed up with dementors to kill crouch dumbledore never argued with him about the verity of harry claims and the potential for an amazing cliff hanger conclusion with dumbledore in all his might giving orders to hagrid and others as a general before the final battle was instead replaced by a horrible attempt at a eulogy combining direct quotations from the novel with poor scriptwriting to make dumbledore out to be a poor speaker as well as incompetent wizard i shudder to think how the next movie will have to deal with all of these plot gaps and how dumbledore can hope to maintain any semblance of respectability when he trusts snape and continues to avoid harry in the fifth movie much better would have been to stick with the original idea and make two movies this movie did not feel like it had any plot one did not become attached to the characters and spent the movie groaning or laughing at the contrived immaturity of it all some acting by harry and friends was good but it was overshadowed by a terrible attempt to fit everything and nothing into the movie ,1
14,EN,888363545,i am an avid member of harry potter club and we went to see it at midnight after waiting and waiting it starts how it should supposed too with harry dream but then we find him already at the weaselly instead of at home with dudley we get none of the scene with the ton tongue toffee also the caddish world cup was very weak we do not get to see any of the character set up for barty crouch and ludo bag man also since we never get to see the percy as crouch assistant also we do not get to see the team mascots and we hardly see any caddish also the wesley malory conflict was not there which sets up characterization for the death eater scene because the wesley do not sit in the ministers box also the whole house elf story line is left out which was really disappointing because it played such a main role in the book and we never get the whole barty crouch son conflict going on another thing was that they left out any mad eye snap tension which was odd also the draco harry conflict was not there the nd task was the best part of the movie the cinematography was amazing and its exactly like the book also there is no classes shown which is quite annoying since thats always on of my favorite parts another thing that upset me was there was no developing of the twins joke shop in the end they never even get the galleons also their were no ha grid spence like with those crab things none of that happened no riflers either the third task sucked it was a bunch of moving bushes no animals the voltmeter confrontation was amazingly good and so was after wards until moody takes harry but due to the lack of house elf it don t make very much sense that crouch son just appear also i forgot their is no spew which left hermine angry sometimes hard to figure it out the movie was good but they left out too much i would have rather had it be longer and less effects then what it was ,1
15,EN,888363545,i have never read nor have i seen any of the harry potter books or the previous movies but having heard all positive comments regarding them i went to see this movie half way through the movie i realized that because i did not read the book most of the movie did not make any sort of sense to me i also got the feeling that they cut out vast amounts of plot from the book so much that the movie just felt like a vague outline of an otherwise maybe enjoyable story scene development were terrible to the point that many events went unexplained maybe to the elementary school kids this is ok but as an educated college student it frustrated me to no ends to top off a movie with no plot continuity the ending made absolutely no attempt to salvage anything and ended on an extremely bland and lifeless note and yes the special effects were awesome but at some point you have to grow up and realize that flying dragons and cool effects do not make up for a badly written script maybe harry potter is just not for me but after the movie i have been told that none of the previous three movies were anywhere close to the inferior quality of this movie drawing the analogy of harry potter iv is to hp i as matrix ii is to matrix i and that i should be a more objective person and not judge the entire harry potter series based on this disappointing experience ,1

17,EN,-1046617570,the intouchables begins with the disoriented action of an elderly white aristocrat being driven at thrilling pace through paris in a maserati by a strikingly tall omar sy as they devilishly evade arrest following a high speed police pursuit the narrative then returns in time to establish this relationship which cleverly exploits the unlikely friendship clich which would otherwise be presumed by the audience as tired before commencement the acting of both francis and omar combines to carry the realism and humanity upon which this magnificent film is grounded in the incredibly dynamic portrayal of a mutual sense of humour which acted as the primary catalyst between philippe and driss is testament to the level of artistry deserving of all awards they received for their performance ludovico einaudi has done a magnificent job at creating a score that not only sounds realistic itself but brings classical profundity and a very french grandeur in to contrast with the very down to earth themes of friendship and raw human nature cinematically flawless the urban landscape of driss hometown becomes equally visually appealing as the aristocratic parties and over decorated sweeping hallways of philippe mansion long lens portraiture on wet paris streets with dancing bokeh consistently delivers as cinematography explores both the romance and cold edginess of the city colour palate while the intouchables delivers in all sections of production and narrative value the story lacked legitimacy and depth when delving into the life of driss and at times felt slightly tokenistic and perhaps too evidently conceived from high budget production despite the lack of a grungy social representation that maybe i wrongly expected i vote this film as just short of absolute brilliance ,8
18,EN,-1046617570,this movie plays for shock effect as well as titters it is filled with rude remarks to women in fact driss seems to think that women are only good for one thing but it is passed off as funny in the movie well if i were that poor secretary in the movie i feel it is just about sexual harassment his attitudes toward fat women or ugly women are equally crude yes it puts more of a kick into the life of a quadriplegic but on a crude level for the most part and with adolescent behaviors driss laughing at the opera especially because it is in german is ruining an experience for the whole theater of people who want to enjoy it and there is driss driving the sports car through paris speeding weaving in and out of traffic making high speed turns it looks so professional from the driver seat but imagine if you were in that traffic with him it is incredibly dangerous forget about driss for the other people on the road i kept waiting for driss to wake up and find his better self but no this is not that movie there is no transformation no this is a guy movie and i mean that with all the derision used on chix flick ,3
19,EN,-1057031135,i recently saw minority report with several of my friends and each of us thought that the film was an excellent piece of cinematic genius steven spielberg has once more proven that he can make a film that will both leave you on the edge of your seat and make you think tom cruise has reclaimed his fame in my book and has propelled himself into my top ten actor list my favorite actor of all time begin brad pitt of course although i will not divulge the plot of the film for the sake of those poor souls who still have yet to see it i will say that i was greatly surprised and delighted by it and i think that the best idea in the entire film had to be those sweet guns that john anderton cruise had to spin around the ones that fired those balls of sound energy from the part in the lexus assembly line however thought those guns up was a genius surely minority report is an excellent film worth seeing time and time again and after seeing it you will constantly be saying murder in the voice of agatha one of the pre cogs and come up with scenarios that involve precrime s w a t teams busting through windows and such in conclusion i suggest that everyone go and see minority report but i must put a caution upon it it will make you think and for most americans thinking is a tough avenue to travel ,10
20,EN,-1057031135,so the third of the four must sees this summer movie season is out spider man attack of the clones this men in black ii and i saw it last night with all the buzz about this flick being steven speilberg best movie since raiders of the lost ark i felt as if i should have been standing in line on opening night i mean that pretty tall talk to be better than saving private ryan and schindler list truth be told i was almost willing to pay the # ## just to see the daredevil and red dragon trailers as for the main feature the verdict is good yes i said good well i will even go so far as to say pretty darn good but certainly not speilberg best since raiders just pretty darn good the premise is by now well known washington d c in the year #### has an experimental program in which murders are foreseen by mutated precognitives and potential perpetrators are arrested before their crime can be committed the constitutional arguments are also pretty well known by now but i do not have any intention of getting into a monologue about that as the issue is covered in the movie and it the movie i am here to discuss tom cruise policeman john anderton is the chief of the precrime department of the d c police and has a zeal for the program stemming from the disappearance of his # year old son in the days before the precrime program when a representative of the justice dept arrives to try to poke holes in the program premise before the it instituted nationally anderton is told by his boss played by max von sydow to accommodate him the next thing we know the precogs foresee anderton committing a murder in less then three days time and the chase is on cruise once again displays his mastery of the cold acting method as he did to perfection in jerry maguire and born on the fourth of july but for some strange reason abandoned in vanilla sky he relates his character anguish anxiety terror etc through subtle stares sparse dialogue and body language no ranting and raving no overly preachy stretches of dialogue just a look in the right place here and a sentence under the breath there and the audience gets the idea staring at and speaking in unison with home movie holograms and hobbling about his home strung out on inhaled illegal drugs anderton displays to us his personal misery then returns to dedicated professionalism at the station house the next day he does a fine job of carrying this movie colin farrell who will play bullseye in daredevil next year does a great job as the justice dept errand boy playing him with just the right amount of swarminess is that a word and intelligence von sydow performance is terrific as well and his role here continues the summer theme of taking senior movie veterans and making wonderful use of them cliff robertson in spider man christopher lee in attack of the clones the visuals here are terrific the vision of washington d c ## years from now is more believable than blade runner prediction for los angeles of #### the architecture and technology are not so omnipresent in the capitol that we do not see life as we might would lead it with the exception of the superhighways the technology depicted in the movie is a garnish to life at that time the bluish tint that spielberg gives the film casts an almost sterile hue to the world we see there such that blood when spilled is all the more garish to see i thought it was an interesting touch the sick sticks and retina scanning spider robot bloodhounds used by law enforcement of the day were absolutely creepy the personalized advertisements and greetings depicted here instantly made me think of the crap accumulating in my e mail box every day lasmoak give your lover a larger or lasmoak mortgage rates are now and this hitting me close to home gave a lot of other things in the movie credibility this movie shows us a world where fantasies can be lived out in a chamber is a lot closer than the holodecks of star trek okay the story it good yes i even said it was pretty good this film is not a big budget slam bang modern american action movie and with good reason it is not supposed to be it is big budget do not get me wrong and it all on the screen the visuals and the effects are terrific and they enhance not overpower the plot this movie is a lot more cerebral than i expected and that always a welcome surprise in today movies i confess that i was not prepared for the film noir pace of the movie as hearing all this comparison to raiders had me set for a trill a minute type spectacle well it ai not that but it good nonetheless yes the movie # hours and ##

23,EN,-1616571358,pretty interesting that a candidate from a genre where i would normally not consider adding in my favourite list actually made it this movie impressed me with its originality and a different point of view i have not felt so much for the aliens this is probably the first film that eliminates tereotypes towards aliens although it does have uncertainties and loopholes here and there district # is one step closer towards a highly probably outcome if the situation actually takes place in real life and is likely to form a good base for future movies to come that i hope will create a new market intended for viewers who demand something alien but closer to reality than being imaginary ,7
24,EN,-54095325,as i feel the entire trilogy needs to be taken as a whole trying to review just one piece of it empire strikes back does not feel right imho episode v is the least likely of the trilogy that could stand on it own if it had to because of how this film ends however i can say that the action scenes are superb the acting much improved from episode # and the story just rips along at hyperspeed george lucas was the master of taking what little he had to work with and making it all seem much larger than life alas i am afraid he strayed from his roots while making the prequels enjoy ,8
25,EN,-54095325,a continuation of that masterpiece named star wars the general public went absolutely bonkers for the second chapter of what is now considered the greatest movie trilogy of all time the empire strikes back now re titled episode v is my personal third best of the saga while i can honestly say this is an absolute classic featuring some of the best moments twists and entertainment sequences of any movie it is not my favorite star wars film this may come as a shock to almost all star wars fans but i will be flat out in saying its a bit cheesier than you remember the way some of the scenes play out can be a bit too ## overdone and the way the star wars theme comes in while its what we all love takes a way some of this chapters more realism and darker tone on that note i will also add how excellently different this chapter tries to become from the original because of this most were disappointed at first viewing but there no denying how much it expanded the best fictional universe of all risks are part of making great films the scenes on dagobah featuring yoda are by far some of the best scenes of the entire trilogy and all its nods to the prequels are very fun to listen to however it sets up so many plot holes with the prequels that it truly makes you question if yoda was referring to a different time line a cooler and proper time line will the prequels will ever be rewritten or rebooted for the better extremely better or insanely better than what we sadly received empire strikes back still amazes me today in its practical achievements in terms of sets every thing feels so real in the action scenes unlike the unnatural cartoon atmosphere of the prequels not to mention that this film features the greatest film twist in all of cinema when darth vader finally reveals to luke skywalker i am your father this film amazed me since i first saw it and it will be amazing me for many years to come despite its partial over ration as an overall film itself ,10
26,EN,-54095325,empire strikes back is the prime example of how to do a movie sequel it furthers the story raises the stakes expands the characters and universe goes in daring new directions improves the technicals and fixes any of the flaws found in the previous film empire is a lot darker than its predecessor and this helps to heighten the drama and make the story more compelling as now we truly see the threat the empire can impose it becomes more though provoking as a philosophical side to the force is introduced new equally iconic and beloved characters are introduced characters like yoda lando and boba fett this is also the film that truly defined darth vader as one of the greatest villains of all time as not only is he made more intimidating but also more complex thanks largely to the infamous twist yet the film still manages to be just as fun as the original as we have great space battles and the greatest lightsaber duel of the entire saga yet what makes these action scenes so cowling and exciting is our emotional investment we have with the story and characters you will laugh cry feel tense and cheer once the end credits roll you will be emotionally drained ,10
27,EN,-54095325, the empire strikes back is the best movie made in this century it s really more than a movie it s more a great epic tale brought on the silver screen much darker than a new hope and more grown up like this first milestone empire creates an atmospheric intensity i felt in no other movie so far and believe me i saw a lot the storyline is far more elaborate than those few critics say and anyone who gives this film less than at least # points definitely doesn t know anything about the magic in movie making empire is not only the peak of the star wars trilogy so far but it s sfx still stand up to our cgi overfed era just remember the asteroid field or the battle in the snow on hoth and everything is underlined by the best score john williams ever composed ## points but only because there are no higher ratings possible ,10
28,EN,-54095325,as a kid i was raised on star wars all six of them i loved each one but this one stood out as being one of the worst of the bunch i have no idea why but watching it now it easily the best the plot takes a darker turn and it works perfectly a new hope felt like a somewhat poor beginning to the series a little forced and rushed at times still a good movie though but this one starts it up again and immediately makes it better it picks up right off the bat then slows back down again it quite well paced the characters and their relationships are further developed too now that they are not just a bunch of people thrown together due to circumstances instead their a bunch of people thrown together due to circumstances all supporting the same cause and willing to actually work together overall the empire strikes back is just the best star wars movie it holds up the best of them all and has a serious darker tone that works really well unfortunately not all the movies could be this good in the end i would certainly recommend this movie but if you have not seen it already then you really need to get up and watch them all because your a little late ,10

34,EN,-1940236757,when i first saw this movie i liked it but gave it a lower rating because i felt it carried on too long too much dialogue i went back and saw it again this time i did not have that problem and i was able to appreciate that this is quentin best work since pulp fiction once again quentin shows his love for film and infuses many facets of this work with it we have a fugitive jew running a cinema in paris a german war hero turned propaganda film star a german propaganda star turned double agent a british film critic turned spy his fate is probably a slam on critics and a couple of bloodthirsty us soldiers nicknamed aldo the apache and the bear jew while this movie is titled inglorious basterds and brad pitt does his usual admirable job his italian is something to be seen and heard for me it is the actor who played col landa an actor previously unknown in the us who really turned an outstanding performance the character is evil as virtually every cinematic nazi is but he is also intelligent charming has a flair for languages and an infectious laugh you simply cannot take your eyes off him he alone is well worth the price of a ticket and a dvd with lt aldo raine coming in a close second and the alternate ending to wwii is not too shabby either ,9
35,EN,-1940236757,inglorious basterds is quentin tarantino new film it basically tarantino take on world war ii of course the film is historically inaccurate but they were not going for historical accuracy when making this film quentin tarantino is a great director giving us excellent films such as pulp fiction and kill bill pulp fiction was a masterpiece and he has yet to top it inglorious basterds was a great world war ii film though the best i am not sure but it definitely up there i am usually not a very big fan of brad pitt but he was simply excellent in this film he plays the redneck commander of a squad called the inglorious basterds a team which specializes in killing nazi in my opinion this is pitt best role he is simply hilarious in an otherwise dark war film eli roth and sam levine also play members of the basterds the plot of the film involves two groups of people who are trying to kill hitler and the other nazi one group is the basterds the others are two people who run a movie theatre the woman who runs it had her family killed by the nazi years earlier and wants revenge there is a german officer who is smitten by her as well the acting characters are top notch it is very violent which is expected for a tarantino film though there is not too much action a problem i had with this film was that it dragged quite a bit a lot of tarantino films do this but a lot of the time it works some of it works here as well i found that the opening scene was somewhat of a nod to the apartment scene in pulp fiction we knew something bad was going to happen however the two characters just converse as the suspense builds they could have definitely shortened this film a bit the rest of the movie is great and any tarantino or world war ii film fan should enjoy it ,9
36,EN,-1940236757,the eighth film by quentin tarantino inglourious basterds warning may contain spoilers so a film written and directed by quentin tarantino staring brad pitt christoph waltz m lanie laurent eli roth and michael fassbender i think i will watch that i am going to get right into the story so eight jewish american soldiers dropped into nazi occupied france doing one thing and one thing only killing nazis and then there a jewish girl seeking revenge on the nazis for the massacre of her family but we came for the inglourious basterds now this movie is not the best tarantino movie but it is seen as his masterpiece why because it takes the best elements of his best movies and puts them into one movie this movie has the non linear story telling of pulp fiction the violence of kill bill and the dialogue of a classic tarantino movie was this movie good no it was fantastic it was everything you expect it to be a movie with no deeper meaning or purpose other then being a really great time at the movies so for what this movie is it great if you went into this movie expecting to see an artsy movie like schindler list then honestly i have no idea what your doing going into a movie by quentin tarantino what i would change the only thing i would change about this movie is how little screen time some of the basterds got i really felt that the first draft of this script had a lot more of the basterds doing something more then just being there but it got cut out for time or some bullshit i would have sat through a three hour movie if the extra ## minutes went to the basterds final thoughts all in all this movie is a fantastic movie that i would recommend to anyone ,10

38,EN,-1940236757,wwii drama is actually a fantasy about a small group of american jews who land in nazi occupied france for the purpose of killing as many nazis as possible brad pitt leads this ragtag but deadly group director tarantino breaks up the movie in chapters which makes it comprehensible everything comes to a head at a paris theater debuting the latest nazi made movie nation pride which all the top nazi brass including hitler will be attending pitt is hilarious as lt aldo raine the tennessee born head of the assassins most of the cast is european and unknown here but special mention should be made of chris waltz who plays the fictitious col landa he steals every scene he is in as a flamboyant cruel and opportunistic ss officer on the hunt for jews also an actor named til schweiger makes quite an impression at a former nazi who loves to kill nazis and he does so with a very big knife some film fans may recognize diane kruger as a double agent and in a bit of stunt casting horror director eli roth plays one of the the basterds true film buffs will be reminded of the dirty dozen although this long film ### minutes is not in the same league with that all time classic the music choices are uneven and occasionally disrupt the film gorehounds will certainly enjoy the killings some of which are accomplished with a louisville slugger a couple of closeup scalpings are fun but hard to watch and there an absolutely exquisite moment involving one of pitt fingers poking around in a fresh leg wound a good not great film perhaps better viewed in segments when it arrives on dvd ,7

49,EN,1117674556,there no point resisting it it comes around once a year and though it does not feel like it you will enjoy it once it arrives if you think about it christmas and british romantic comedies are so similar it surprising they have not been teamed up before the latest offering from richard curtis is called love actually and it does just that weaving the destinies of a huge array of characters as the on screen countdown closes in on the inevitable christmas eve climax the film is curtis first as director and this is a fact that weighs unbearably on the man and his movie as love actually is a mess uneven in tone throughout and never managing to achieve any sense of depth to it sketched out characters while being far from a complete failure the film many and varied pleasures are too often overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the project with too much screen time devoted to stories which frustrate rather than enrich in what must surely be the last time that the formula can be wheeled out to any degree of success all the staples with which we have been so accustomed are present and correct you want a scene involving repeated profanity for comic effect check a man dancing in his underwear to naff ##s music of course dido on the soundtrack why not a kid in an octopus suit we have got plenty of them and lobsters too as obvious as all the above may be these familiar concoction still works and the final half an hour of the film is as always the most interesting there are too many wasted opportunities along the way though too many character studies that are merely touched upon rather than investigated we have no time to invest emotionally in these people and so there is little pleasure in seeing their various love lives get sorted out the hugely underused andrew lincoln gets the film most fitting line when he pauses to proclaim enough ironically just when we are dying for more on his particular situation lincoln is a case in point that for every plot that goes on too long there is one of which we want to see more emma thompson is excellent in what is essentially the movie best and most well written role and the scene in which she receives an unexpected christmas gift from her husband almost steals the entire film laura linney is also superb in an intriguing but frustratingly truncated role as a woman whose retarded brother rules her life the rest of the cast are happy enough to cruise through their under written parts in first gear many of them simply reprising their characters from the assorted british television realms from which they are gathered the central focus is left to hugh grant to be hugh grant something which he does of course do very well even the most dyed in the wool grant fan may be disappointed by his predicament as even he is not allowed the screen time his character the prime minister for goodness sake deserves the scenes in which he does appear are usually enjoyable though particularly one which features that octopus i mentioned earlier indeed it is perhaps the children who hold the key to why the movie does not fall flat on its face as the school christmas concert in both build up and aftermath is undeniably charming it is a good job that love actually does childhood emotion very well because when it attempts to address the wider issues it veers dangerously close to bad taste grant is the victim of cringe worthy writing on both occasions both of which involve clumsy attempts to tackle the post # ## relationship between britain and america again this is the same syndrome of over ambition because curtis undoubtedly does the simple things very well indeed it just a pity that the poignant moments jar too often with those attempts that are less successful there is plenty to enjoy here to ensure the crowds flock in and guarantee that the curtis and grant double act will be back there are however enough cracks and jars appearing in the winning formula to ensure that future efforts will have to progress considerably you get the feeling that richard curtis ambition has got the better off him in love actually and while his confidence in handling ## different story threads in his debut directorial outing is to be admired his inexperience is too often noticeable and to the detriment of his finished article our attention is frequently drawn to the soundtrack on which love is all you need is a recurring and insistent refrain john lennon lyrics urge a return to the basics and the bare essentials if only curtis had taken the advice he is so desperate to communicate to his audience ,10
50,EN,1117674556, love actually is a film of exquisitely delicate emotions blended with just the right touches of humor to keep it from becoming maudlin everyone in the film appears to be an emotional train wreck waiting to happen they dangle precariously at the end of their respective ropes over chasms of heartache but what is so rewardingly beautiful is that each survives through different kinds of strength inspiring viewers to find within their own strength in facing similar disasters the incidental entwining with the christmas season lends the many disparate stories a sort of framework that supports their almost imperceptible weight writer director richard curtis true to form constructs a brilliant and complex work that in the hands of lesser directors might have come off as diffused and ineffective but in his hands comes together with astonishing elegance and power craig armstrong score is so beautifully subtle and yet powerful that it weaves with the delicacy of silk and the strength of steel throughout the film masterfully setting its tone and unifying the diverse subplots into a seamless whole the additional music is cunningly selected to provide counterpoint to armstrong score while at the same time complementing it perfectly the cast is beyond compare superb to the last detail i cannot even imagine where to begin singling anyone out so i wo not try suffice it to say that in typical british style the entire ensemble shines as a whole without any one cast member overshadowing another no mean feat when the credits read like a who who of what i would call serious cinema there are so many moments to treasure that once again i will not even attempt to single any out you simply must experience them for yourself which i recommend without reservation this is yet another of those incidentally christmas themed movies that i watch without fail every holiday season i could continue spewing superlatives but i think you get the idea i love love actually ,10
51,EN,112908349,i thought this movie was the best movie of the ##s it has it all great sets incredible style awesome acting from everyone including kiefer sutherland and a great sci fi fantasy story i cannot wait until proyas directs another movie ,8
52,EN,112908349,i will start with the good set design is very very well done in alex proyas dark city the lighting and costume design are all quite comprehensible and work as well as the cinematography all contributing to the overall atmosphere of this neo noir cult film in my personal taste i would have liked to see the set even darker even at the cost of hiding some of the wonderful backgrounds moving on the music scoring comes and goes in terms of decency connelly parts in the nightclub are lackluster bad jazz in my opinion the acting is hollywood caliber although i am afraid keifer character was a bit annoying speech haircut be ready for rufus and his distracting lazy eye i do not doubt that they cast him with that in mind which helps to portray the craziness of the character psionic powers cheap gimmick obvious plot device hoakey personally did not like that dr schreber only exists to advance to story through dialogue i do not generally care for this type of storytelling the stangers should have only been revealed at the end of the movie the sheer intimidation factor of a dagger that extends a half inch is greatly terrifying believe me however redundant a half inch what is the point d the stranger who was a child the only one apparently does not quite make sense in my opinion as it would only hinder his role by limiting him physically this can be seen when he is forced to bite john hand rather than pry his fingers loose or perhaps step on them maybe he should have used his mind powers to fling john from the building oh wait they only use powers when it convenient for the story frankly i had trouble suspending my disbelief i just could not get into it gosh darn it if i was put into john shoes you would know i would have made sweet sweet love to melissa george in the beginning shame on him if you are considering watching this movie and are browsing through the reviews to get an idea of what you are in for just click back on your browser and forget you ever heard of dark city ,1
53,EN,1054281284,i took a look at this film with a slightly wary eye the title being rather ambiguous and misleading initially i almost passed it by to watch one of the many screener dvd i had to view for possible inclusion in the bafta awards i presumed it was about a runner or maybe an indian astronaut possibly i had no idea initially the indian referred to a great american motorcycle rather than a particular type of human i am so glad i was not thrown by the title and started watching there unfolded a most delightful story about bert an instantly rather charming eccentric old character superbly played by anthony hopkins who built an old #### motorcycle in his garden shed he then attempts to break the world land speed record on a machine designed to originally travel about ##mph the plot develops into a most charming and beautiful story of bert determination to get to the race event and the journey is as much of the story as the event itself obviously i shall not divulge the result or the events that happen suffice it to say that bert becomes an instantly likable character by everyone he meets bert charm shines through and he takes everyone he meets at face value and welcomes all with a smile and a shake of the hand he meets various characters along the way who he befriends like long lost friends which is a fresh in these days of prejudice and alienation this was a very innocent time in #### for a new zealander going to america and there is one of the films most delightful and charming moments when bert realises all is not quite what it seems when he meets one certain character make sure you see this film it will have you laughing crying and will uplift you which is quite uncommon in these days in the movies of blood killing violence and savagery i would be very surprised if anthony is not at least nominated for his starring role as bert lovely film which needs a different title to me but then again it does what it says on the tin as they say go and see it great,9
54,EN,-1401867705,can the last five minutes of a film ruin what was until that point a really great thriller yes they can as the ending of the game demonstrates this review contains a spoiler so if you do not want to know the ending look away now the premise of the story is a rich man agreeing to take part in a game he knows nothing about it or the rules but we are led to believe that his rather empty wealthy life has left him with an overwhelming ennui so this slightly rash decision on his part was sort of credible at the end we discover that all the terrible things that have happened to him being shot at nearly drowned buried alive in mexico his beautiful house being trashed losing his multi million dollar fortune were all faked to make him think these things were happening i could almost have bought that but and here the clincher for me the final act in the game was to make him believe he shot his own brother dead believing this he leaps from the roof of the building to kill himself he falls firstly through the glass roof of the restaurant below then into a huge inflatable crash mat put there to cushion his ## storey fall yes this was just another trick part of the game the whole game was a birthday treat paid for by his brother to spice up his life a bit uh huh what if he would jumped a few feet to one side are we seriously meant to believe that his brother would risk him missing the mat and exploding on the sidewalk as part of a birthday treat ludicrous and then discovering all this the rich guy is all smiles and handshakes and thanks for a great time wow even watching this movie made me want to kill everyone involved in the game how could he go through it and just laugh it off michael douglas is exceptionally good in the film up until the end it a great film but three stars from me ,3
55,EN,-1401867705,is it a hoax a puzzle or a scam no the game is a continual attack on the status quo of a our mark a wildly successful holier than thou investment broker personified by michael douglass does anyone in america not believe that michael douglass is a power broker richer than our wildest dreams brought on by his movie brother sean penn this amazingly elaborate intervention contains a multi layered thrilling plot invigorated by the family theme or motive behind the ruse the rabbit hole of confusion is continually re introduced by the enticing debra kara unger and the suspense ensues entertaining but fincher missed the chance to elevate the film by avoiding deeper personal issues only addressed on the surface would it have hurt the film to find some spirituality from this escapade seemed to take a pass on that chance ,7
56,EN,507607113,the starbucks coffee company up in seattle washington was established the year this sweet movie was made but since it was filmed no where near seattle where the starbucks headquarters is currently located we see no starbucks coffee houses anywhere in the movie making this comment completely irrelevant to the movie but then again is not life kind of irrelevant to people that are already dead and turning into dust if i offended anyone living or now presently dead forgive my ignorance and enjoy the wonderful beverages that starbucks has to offer oh and a clockwork orange is awesome cuz the guy who did the production design also did it for star wars episode # ,10
57,EN,1431522379,this movie is disappointing for me when people talk in this movie they sound like delivering speeches i prefer people to talk normal perhaps the script writer is a speech writer the fight choreography is boring my guess is there was no fight choreographer also they should use a double for anne hathaway so she does not look so sissy sluggish and fake the movie relies on the audience remembering what happened in the previous movie unfortunately i do not so the first part of the movie is kind of confusing batman is unusually weak in this movie and if you expect a spectacular fight between batman and the villain at the end you would be disappointed the movie is also unnecessarily long a lot of the side plots can be cut out ,4
58,EN,1431522379,i wish i could say so many good things about this movie but i really cannot tdkr falls short of its predecessors the characters are sheep fair and simple they have little to no development and are completely cardboard based the main plot takes to long to even start and this ends relatively quickly there were no shockers in this movie it was all very predictable one of my many problems with this movie was the acting talia death was the most un realistic thing i have ever seen it looked as though she was taking a nap our hero death itself was cardboard it did not draw a gasp from any of the audience many came out disappointed a few effects did resonate through afterwards though it made me realise how scared humans can be herded into a paddock of fear and twisted beliefs i suppose it did create the spark of a psychological effect this soon died out i watched this with my cousin as were are both avid batman fans we both came out disappointed at one point we considered walking out after the movie ended as we were heading home he said that three hours i wasted in there when i could have been doing something far more productive what a waste of money the film gets a # out of ## for me if you took off your fan boy goggles you might realise how many plot holes there really are and how poor this movie really is ,6
59,EN,1431522379,the good nolan trademark cinematography shines through again showing us that he understands how to make gotham look awesome great villain bane is probably one of the most badass looking characters in batman his voice is evil and patronising and he is played by tom hardy who gives a very body language driven performance catwoman she is really good and smoking hot in that latex suit fighting and action scenes are the best of the trilogy when batman fights bane the first time it seems more like a fight with words rather than punches and bane wins both the mental and physical battle with batman the destroyed football stadium and the plane scene were the best action scenes the bad the plot this plot is exactly the same as batman begins the league of shadows comes to make terror in gotham but instead of destroying gotham right away bane wants to make the city suffer the impending doom of destruction for six months whilst the criminals are ruling the streets and the high class are executed batman meanwhile is stuck in a prison in an unspecified location with a broken back he needs to get back to save gotham from bane the only differences between the two are how the plan to destroy gotham is carried out the beginning of the film and the ending if you put the batman begins and the dark knight rises next to each other they are pretty much the same the film was boring i was really bored batman begins and the dark knight were the two batman films where i actually thought that superheroes are the new greek mythology in this i could get through the first and second acts okay despite the fact that they did not make any sense but the third act was just boring there was no tension or drama it was just a run of the mill superhero ending batman goes and saves gotham you think he dead but it turns out he still alive and with selena kyle despite the fact there was no mention that the two ever hooked up which reminds me the ending i hate the ending it was not subtle at all alfred is in a bar in italy and looks up and smiles i thought they are gonna end it here right but no they actually show bruce and selena together yeah really subtle there and to top it off it seems hollywood wants a film about robin because it ends with him inheriting the batcave bravo terrible ending christian bale as batman this is a pet peeve i have always had with the nolan trilogy christian bale is not batman his acting is too over the top when he is batman he not really that intimidating when he sounds like a scary monster from a badly dubbed anime when he bruce wayne he fine but that also another thing wrong with the movie they make batman look like he in his late ##s at the beginning and make him look even older because of the fact that he has a cane the leg becomes a really bad plot device when they fix his leg which we find out could have been fixed at any given time overall verdict # ## okay it a real shame that i did not like this film as much as i thought i would i was very hyped for this film being a huge fan of anything batman and the nolan trilogy this film was a huge disappointment and a big slap in the face to me it does have redeeming qualities but when it comes down to it it was okay nothing spectacular in all honesty why does the third movie always have to suck the hardest ,6
60,EN,1431522379,this one got me more emotionally involved than the previous two installments but still feels like it lacks real substance the images of the october revolution repeating itself in new york er gotham are chilling but the movie holds back and it should not let us see alfred and lucius fox hang let see catwoman gang raped let see batman really die that the problem with hollywood movies especially of the superhero genre in what i suspect is fear of alienating a large portion of the audience they do not allow anything of real consequence to happen in the story when all is said and done everyone still lives everyone is happy with no hint of the tremendous social impact that bane reign would have left on the city and the world the dark knight was a step in the right direction and its immense popularity attests to that but instead of building on its success and going even further nolan apparently got cold feet which is a shame because he had all the elements great actors great special effects to create a truly great movie ,7
61,EN,1431522379,christopher nolan influenced a rare and astonishing phenomenon back in #### he united critics and fanboys in glorious peaceful accordance few would argue with the notion that the dark knight is the greatest superhero movie ever made no other comic book movie even comes close none to compare the dark knight with lesser films like thor or captain america or the amazing spiderman is like comparing michael jordan with kobe bryant why even bother but it seems that the overwhelming success of the dark knight has placed nolan in an interesting position his masterpiece left a hungry audience with rising expectations which is reasonable effect would not it be weird to walk in a screening of the dark knight rises and expect the second greatest superhero movie ever made whether this closing chapter is better than its predecessors is not a major concern all three batman movies are exhilarating and memorable and it can be said that they belong in a league of their own as an artist who is constantly propelled to challenge our minds christopher nolan adapts the superhero genre but does not conform to its traditions he constructs a dark and ominous world that very close to our own a world separated from the detached happy go lucky playground occupied by the heroes of the avengers read more here http localmoviereview com dark knight rises review ,8
62,EN,1431522379,before i begin this review i would just like to mention the fact it is a sequel to two of the best hero movies produced in film history so batman the dark knight rises tells the story of when bruce wayne christian bale has come out of an # year exile following an unforgettable event in dc film history the death of gothams white knight harvey dent wayne is now faced with what appears to be a group of notorious terrorists consisting of the legendary league of shadows own trained mercenary bane tom hardy who is forcing batman back to his way of batman and aspiring to finish ras al ghul destiny he is also faced with losing his reputation of being batman along side fighting with him is dcs own cat burglar catwoman anne hathaway but who side is she actually on together they need to stop these terrorists with personal problems along side twisting their lives mentally and physically i think the dark knight rises is a really good movie with outstanding sfx such as the football match scene and nail biting hand to hand combat throughout making you feel you are in the movie itself fighting along side the characters also with a dark atmosphere and characters with dark souls molded by dark worlds it a dark film with a serious sense to it the casting is well fabulous by choosing the bulk and deep personality of tom hardy and shifting it into a evil terrorist what more is needed apart from bale outstanding stereotypical hero acting also to put a cherry on this action packed amazing movie cake the music brings out all significant scenes thanks to the one and only master of music himself hans zimmer it just comes to show how music portrays the darkness of films like this and the affect of wanting to carry on watching the movie my final point is the fact it is so original no stereotypes in here what so ever with a twisting plot with many ways to view it depending on your personality i am only ## so i view it as a action related masterpiece it is not your stereotypical movie so will the bat be back for more or is it a perfect end to a perfect trilogy ,8
63,EN,1431522379, the dark knight rises is nothing short of a masterful end to the greatest superhero saga ever put to film layered thoughtful intense and completely satisfying this is the end that we have all been waiting and hoping we would get after the dark knight blew us away in the summer of #### the film takes place eight years after the events in tdk giving us a cleaned up gotham and a reclusive and broken down bruce wayne who has not touched the bat suit since he took the heat for harvey dent crimes but a new enemy threatens gotham a villain willing to blow it all away in order to restore balance bane a smart villain that also matches batman in strength a fresh feeling for these films we witness a batman here who is more human than ever more war torn than ever and who is more defeatable than ever with gotham on the brink of destruction bruce has to summon all that he has in order to stop a threat that is more personal to him than he has ever faced before the dark knight has to rise while tdkr may lack the break neck speed violence and ferocity of the dark knight not to mention the greatest super villain performance of all time in the late heath ledger it makes up ground in its story telling and character development bruce played to perfection by christian bale is pushed to his absolute limits here as is his great city which up until this film has only been toyed with here it is completely and devastatingly brought to its knees at the hands of bane played with a brutal sophistication by the great tom hardy who because of a restrictive mask on his character face acts using his eyes in a fierce and passionate way anne hathaway gives us a cat woman who is not just pretty to look at as in batman returns but is smart sassy and in control alfred the butler played with gusto by the great michael caine certainly gives the film its emotional center if he does not make your eyes water up nothing will gary oldman morgan freeman cilian murphy and marion cotillard round out a cast that is nothing short of superb and do not forget about joseph gordon levitt whose character john blake is much more important than we first think just wait the dark knight rises is the most epic superhero movie of all time hands down in every way possible the film budget and mind blowing visuals very little cgi match the intensely compelling story and the rich characters blow for blow as a capper to the greatest superhero saga of all time and as a film on its own the dark knight rises soars above our expectations and compels us to stand up and cheer for what one man can accomplish when he is pushed to his limits the batman remains the ultimate superhero thomas bond thefilmdiscussion com,9
64,EN,1431522379,contrary to what many others are saying i thought this was a better movie to the previous two it does not have the heath ledger factor but i personally found the dark knight ending with the boats a little underwhelming not so here the dark knight rises is excellently paced and it builds from the outset to an incredible finale bane is a intimidating villain and this version is a really dark take on the character i am sure kids will be scared witless yes his voice is hard to understand at times but the audio effect used is really nice and actually once we hear him a little more clearly like in the football stadium he becomes less ominous we never actually get to see his face and it is amazing to think tom hardy is under there he looks massive and very powerful the best thing about catwoman is that no one actually refers to her as catwoman i had my doubts about anne hathaway ability to pull it off but she really is magnificent as memorable as michelle pfeiffer but a completely different more real world take on the character in keeping with the rest of nolan films no proper cat costume but every bit as feline she plays a person torn between her slightly villainous nature and her good side and love of batman perfectly ra al ghul is also woven beautifully into the story everything is seamless and it really is brilliant story telling with a lovely twist at the end with the very lovely marion cotillard which luckily i had not read about it was a great bookend to a trilogy which must be the best ever made i find it difficult to believe that bale will not return for another episode or two despite what he says he really is brilliant the ending is left perfectly open ended with an introduction to robin gordon levitt is a great choice and from what i have seen is one of the most promising young actors around right now a special nod to the audio in the movie which is really incredible throughout especially when gotham explodes also some nice catwoman versions of the score which reminded me of nick arundel work on arkham city for those that say this is not the proper batman in the first episode batman was trained by ninjas and that was not in the comic books until #### nolan made it very clear from begins that he was reinterpreting batman in a more modern and realistic way so if you are a batman purist who likes the golden age style batman then technically you should have given up after the first movie bane is not a guy twice batman size who drank the venom formula with tubes protruding from his body he is a tough and gritty mercenary of realistic proportions similarly the joker did not use chemicals electric shock hands and laughing false teeth he used knives and dirty explosives more like the darker joker from the graphic novels the theme has been very consistent throughout the trilogy and it has been an awesome journey this is an outstanding end to it,9
65,EN,1431522379,just returned from the movie and i am still in awe it has become without a doubt my fav trilogy of all time good direction acting production its got it all although ppl found it to be too long i did not might be cos most bwood movies r that long n im kinda used to it p bale hathaway freeman levitt cotillard oldman hardy n of course caine give grt performances good background score as well there were quiet a few references to the prev movies which i loved the movie is truly epic various scenes such as wen bane takes over gotham the rise of the dark knight and of course the opening scene featuring little finger from game of thrones will def give goosebumps the movie however was not as good as tdk but then again i din expect it to be very few movies in the genre match up to tdk overall grt work nolan amazing movie cant w# # man of steel snyder nolan def worth a watch,9
66,EN,1431522379,nolan has done justice to each and every role in the movie if you ever to know the actual roles played by the protagonists and antagonists in the batman comics or watched the animated series for those who are bored or i have other stuff to do weirdo every character in the movie or the entire trilogy is accounted for ra al ghul was a tyrant who was chaotic but with a motive tried to destroy gotham in the first movie but batman foils the plan and gets recognition in gotham as the the new vigilante that criminals run scared that continues in the second when all the criminal kingpins like cats when cornered try to fight back and make the mistake of hiring joker who they underestimate and take for any regular criminal who follows orders but he had a mind of his own to prove a point that one day call it the most unfortunate of his where everything fell apart and drove him insane no matter how much of an earthly and sane life he wanted to spend all that story he tells that creeps the sh t out of people he wants to see the fear in them that even the most regular normal sane and law abiding citizen of any country when pushed to the edge can fall into the abyss of that unending chaos of a life where rules emotions pain and suffering does not matter what matters only is to prove a point comes into picture but batman prevails making himself take the blame just to prove his own point that he learnt from harvey that you die a hero or live long enough to become a villain in the eyes of the society then comes the third part of the trilogy where the dark knight in exile underestimates his opponent who is hell bent on destroying gotham to fulfill the promise of ra al ghul from the first movie all connected and also that all his batman effort to save gotham is beyond saving dont we feel with all these shootouts chaos sorrow and the innocent dying for no apparent reason that this world is beyond saving that there is no hope tell me there is probably only a fool who still has hope for this city state country nation or world and that my friends was the batman character one who did not give up that fools hope bane comes into picture with talia ra al ghul legacy who according to comics infact does fall in love with batman but cannot leave her father side and darkknight satisfies all of them here the character catwoman is a common man who shares the same feeling she did in the movie about the world so all in all it a true justice a perfect ending and an immense deshi basara to character of the darkknight ,10
67,EN,1431522379,i read both good and bad reviews of tdkr personally i am with the good guys also i consider unfair the comparison between tdk with tdkr i think the last is the logical consequence of the previous bb tdk and tdkr becomes a solid trilogy connected with much care i remember that tdk was a kind of never ending spiral of unfortunate events and one can easily feel that it impossible to become the things worse than this tdkr shown to me how wrong i was during the first # # of the movie almost ### consecutive minutes of increasing depress and darkness one can easily remember another masterpiece in spite of it different genre polansky the pianist and the low motion destruction of the way of life of the polish jews yes there one disturbing gap in the movie the unrealistic last breath of miranda tate unusual in a great actress like marion cotillard but it not enough to condemn this masterpiece as i read in many reviews the great message of nolan trilogy is batman was not alone bruce wayne never could become batman without the support of gordon fox and alfred it a beautiful statement of friendship and loyalty congratulations christopher making another batman move became a very difficult challenge for the next generations of directors ,10
68,EN,1431522379,there are no perfect movies and there are no perfect directors but there are great movies and great directors the dark knight rises may not be the greatest movie ever made comes close to that but christopher nolan is definitely the greatest director hollywood mainstream cinema has ever produced i am not kidding or this is no bombastic exaggeration four years ago christopher nolan delivers one of the finest pieces of modern cinema complemented by a stunning performance by heath ledger as the joker the joker is considered the best arch nemesis of batman he has a dark and twisted sense of humor he psychotically intelligent and a sadistic genius nolan recreates a sinister psychopath like no other batman comics did remember how the joker narrates two different stories to rachel and gambol on how he gets the scars that said ledger mannerisms have pushed the joker to the ultimate levels of villain ism so much that he is the only actor to have ever won the oscar for playing a comic book character even before the movie was released everyone was doubtful if joker role could be reprised tom hardy bane is no heath ledger joker bane is all about power and control by force joker does this by corruption true to the character in comics bane is the only arch rival of batman who has inflicted physical pain to batman thus pushing batman to the limits of human endurance and emotions which was not done by joker so if you ask me who great joker or bane i will have diverse answers but with justifications back to the movie if batman begins is a towering adaptation of the comic book character the dark knight is a grandiose noir epic and the dark knight rises is with expectations running high among the fans after the highly successful and critically acclaimed the dark knight nolan has directed this intricate end to the trilogy trying to live to the expectations did he succeed my answer is yes the horizon of super eminence set by the spectacular the dark knight is mercilessly trampled over by the dark knight rises in a transcending phenomenal tale of rage destruction power and redemption the incredible story telling is well supported by joseph gordon levitt marion cotillard micheal caine morgan freeman anne hathway not in any order though each of them delivers thumping and truly amazing performance if you are wondering that i missed tom hardy and christian bale i just parked them for a bigger praise tom hardy as bane is ruthless strong stronger than batman intelligent and organized he delivers one of the finest roles by in a villainous role where he equally matched against batman the mask through which an analgesic gas passes without which bane cannot survive adds to his demonic demeanor which is accentuated further by his voice his voice is cold scary and chilling christian bale is tailor made for batman he has immortalized batman forever his emotions choices rules and transitions between bruce wayne and batman make him perhaps the pick of the entire acting prowess in this movie technically speaking this has to the best movie ever made hans zimmer background score is definitely a mile better than his own score in the previous installment in fact i can rank this next only to james horner score in titanic the best ever bg score ever in a movie if a picture is worth thousand words then wally pfister cinematography is worth every splendiferous word found in the dictionary this movie has set a new level in hollywood film making the transitions between the scenes happen very butter smooth every scene is executed meticulously well the imax scenes are superbly shot giving us the immersive feeling into the movie couple of shots not mentioning them as i do not want to spoil your movie watching experience are genuinely new and can be ranked as the best ever in any movie if you ever wanted to know what adrenaline rush means if you ever wanted to know what master class film making means if you ever wanted to know what an impeccable movie should be like rush to your nearest theater preferably an imax and i assure you that you will slip from your comfortable resting the back position to the edge of the seat with time as the movie gets better and better with every passing minute for the first time ever while watching a movie i was sad because the legend has finally come to an end you will just fall in love with this movie and do not go by those murky reviews out there which will spoil the fun i will watch the movie a second time and a third perhaps a fourth time too ,10
69,EN,796365900,the boondock saints has a nice refreshing story with some real excellent acting even though at times willem dafoe at times goes too much over the top and the direction was quite clever it all about these two irish guys who work in a meat packing factory who get sick and tired of the russian mafia bullying the people in the irish neighbourhood they live in so what starts out as a bar fight ends up with them killing two of the russian mafia guys even though they were kind of pressured into it so they decide to become vigilante and kill evil doers and rope in the help of one of their crazed italian american friends also in this is the gay fbi agent played by willem dafoe who is in charge of the investigation he is really smart and is quite good but not perfect at deducing what had happened at each crime scene he ends up having a moral dilemma though which ended up being good for the story the italian mafia end up hiring an insane bounty hunter played by billy connolly to track down and kill the irish lads it has a nice little twist near the end and is thoroughly entertaining if you liked snatch and lock stock then you should like this # ##,9
70,EN,796365900,from top to bottom this film shines with comedy action and drama creating a mix of genres that anyone will love willem defoe performance is in my humble opinion the best performance of his career and the studios wanted bill murray to play smecker of course the actor who stole the show was david della rocco he was an excellent actor who i hope will show up again in other films the film raises several moral questions they kill people who would kill good people the saints kill mobsters pimps and thugs are their actions truly harming society who knows for sure ,10

73,EN,1970697805,down here in asia cinematic artforms are regularly being diluted and i regret saying that i had the opportunity to watch this film from an illegal source i am still wondering whether this modern day introspect of human violence and neo nazism will ever make it to local cinemas just like the many a great films that were banned and or suffered under the unkind treatment dished out by the board of censors ed norton was very believable in the portrayal of a ultra violent neo nazi turned savior of his family but how many of these characters in real and not reel life can we actually claim are successful after going through numerous correctional penitentiary facilities edward furlong on the other hand reprises his brooding nature a young james dean and can very well beat the other ex child star leo in what is eating gilbert grape in all a tragic ending that leaves audience brooding ,10

75,EN,851622481,this is a movie good for people of all ages from the young to the adult i enjoyed it just as my friend did as well the animation was good the storyline was pretty well thought out with bits and pieces of funny stuff thrown into the cartoon with it being a movie made based on several games it would help if you were a gamer though that is really really not essential to understanding the movie this is because it helps if you recognise the side characters portrayed and may help add to the humor but i repeat this is not essential and will no way affect how one enjoys the movie so grab a popcorn and a drink and sit back to enjoy the movie with your family or friends ,8

77,EN,940735587,with a new director at the helm in paul greengrass and the return of star matt damon this second film in the jason bourne series amps up the tension from frame one and never lets go damon remains in fine form as the amnesiac super spy building on his character arc even more as bourne starts having memories come back from his checkered past we begin to learn more about the events that lead to the happenings of the first movie who bourne had been after when he was attacked and left for dead more information about project treadstone and its operations and why they are so keen on bourne being eliminated damon chemistry with his costars remains captivating as he must play cat and mouse with the cia and deals with grief when his lover marie is killed in the film opening act joining the game is an excellent joan allen as pamela landy the new head of the task force that must capture bourne at all costs allen does a top notch job playing pam as neutral as possible even though she is adversarial at first to damon bourne because she thinks he is killing her operatives but her sympathetic side surfaces when she learns who is actually behind the deed and decides to aid bourne search for truth joining allen but playing the real villain like role is brian cox as treadstone head ward abbott who will stop at nothing to rid the cia of jason bourne in order to protect himself cox plays the role with a smooth gravitas that is not overdone or outright malevolent but more subdued and calculated and at last in the network of players is julia stiles as nicky parsons stiles appeared briefly in bourne identity as a minor character nicky is finally expanded upon and given a larger role to play as she holds one key to jason bourne past she stays mostly on the sidelines throughout the film but becomes central by the climax the film narrative like its predecessor deviates from the source material it was based on killing off bourne love interest marie in the first ## minutes of the film is the biggest change that stands out marie remains alive in the novels upon which the trilogy is based bourne marries her and has a family by the bourne ultimatum but her death in the film is meant to add an extra personal touch for bourne to return and go after treadstone the action remains tense and thrilling as bourne fights his way to washington d c from all over europe this film is even better than the first but in a class of its own ,9

79,EN,616211544,over the last few decades the sports genre has become a home of seemingly endless clich s and entries with predictable endings though there have been some surprisingly pleasant and occasionally original sports flicks it is almost difficult to deny the overpopulation of formula the genre continues to throw at us director david o russell however grants us with an idea that though is not empty of formula or particularly original feels fresh by execution and writing tackling on the true story of middleweight boxer dicky eklund and his young brother micky ward who followed in his footsteps this biographical drama showcases not only the triumph of david o russell directing but the powerful performances by it endearing cast based on true events in ####s new jersey the film follows the story of micky ward played by mark wahlberg a recently divorced lightweight boxer sprawling his way to score the championship title with the help of his half brother dicky eklund played by christian bale a former championship boxer who career took a downward spiral from his drug addiction after suffering a humiliating loss micky finds his chance of making to the championship threatened from there on he meets bartender charlene played by amy adams who he quickly falls in love with soon when dicky petty crimes land him in jail his relationship with micky and their already dysfunctional family is put to the test that threatens to not only destroy his chances of winning the championship title but tear the family apart altogether the most important thing in life is family a powerful message this film packs in and with david o russell profound direction the movie falls nothing short of riveting even if it little predictable in some spots instead of relying on heavily on the lead character journey as a boxer fighting to reach the championship rank the plot explores through family dynamics with micky family and the dysfunctional relationships that plague the everyday life his parents played by melissa leo and jack mcgee are constantly at odds with one another and struggle trying to balance their parenting with their seven daughters and their two sons micky and dicky this results in multiple scenes of verbal sparring that are both intense and emotional to sit through when dicky lands himself in prison the family is forced to face emotional obstacles that place a strain on them and david o russell maps this out in a way that more riveting than formulaic when micky and his family face these troubles he learns his only chance of redemption is overcoming his inner demons and making things right with his troublesome brother yes there are some boxing scenes which are brilliantly shot with sheer authencity and of course the usual training montages you see more often than not but it is the tumultuous relationship between the two lead characters that plays the vital role in the story aside from this is mark wahlberg giving one of the most astounding performances of his career but nowhere near as profounding as christian bale who embraces his role with powerful emotional heft that is difficult to ignore another shocking performance comes from amy adams who is equally tremendous but also more feisty and aggressive than the roles she often known for in fact one scene includes her engaging in a fist fight that ends in a broken nose the story would be nowhere near as powerful and compelling if it were not for the astounding performances this cast delivers the fighter is a triumphant piece of cinema that never feels contrived or uninspired in any sense from the astounding performances and david o russell witty direction this film is easily one of the best films of #### no this film is not another rocky or raging bull but it does not have to be what makes the film entertaining is that it smart moving and demonstrates a cinematic effort worth admiring ,9

85,EN,118508639,haunted by memories of a deceased teenage daughter a lonely linguist agrees to assist in communicating with an extraterrestrial species in this first contact sci fi outing from denis villeneuve the film looks sounds and feels like villeneuve earlier icario with aerial shots that bask in lush landscapes another perfectly brooding j hann j hannsson music score and yet another plot about a young woman out of her depth the action content here is negligible though which renders arrival refreshingly different from most other first contact movies as the film focuses on credible barriers with alien communication the big question is whether the aliens are hostile or peaceful since it is impossible to understand them the communication theme is not limited to the aliens though with spaceships landing in twelve places around the world issues arise from various countries being unwilling to share information much like under the skin the film also highlights humankind tendency to always react violently to what we do not understand but there is actually a positive tone overall the film has some pacing issues though the conclusion is overly drawn out with at least a couple of false endings and the final few scenes only serve to blatantly spell out plot twists and turns that did not need to be explicitly stated the scenes of various young military personnel having their doubts also distract from the protagonist journey whatever the case amy adams is solid in the lead role villeneuve lets his camera focus on her trembling hands as well as her face allowing her to give a true full body performance strong support also comes from forest whitaker and jeremy renner even if it sometimes feels like they could have been given more to do ,6
86,EN,118508639, arrival arrives garlanded with a lot of critical praise why i ask myself since denis villeneuve latest is fundamentally a load of old codswallop but with pretensions it certainly entertaining villeneuve is if nothing else a consummate professional but surely the comparisons with kubrick and tarkovsky are not only misplaced but insulting to two much finer filmmakers a more likely companion piece is robert zemeckis contact they both share a strong heroine down to the sentimentality surrounding life birth and naturally death it also full of gobbledygook about language that might not endear it to a multiplex crowd given that they have virtually nothing to do but look puzzled amy adams jeremy renner and forest whittaker are not half bad the aliens themselves look like giant octopi putting this more in the category of the monster flics that america produced in the fifties rather than what appeared post #### reasonably enjoyable then but hardly oscar material ,6

90,EN,1664867938,in an ideal world i would rate this a film # but because some users have been rating this film as low as a # i feel it is necessary to balance their ridiculous scoring out by giving a ## because its just not fair this film is no less than a # # and whoever has scored this film lower than that must have a chip on their shoulder or watched the film with a closed mind interstellar is a fantastic film and that is what is it a film it is not real life and would not happen in real life yet some people and critics take it way too serious why so serious son as a film goes i personally do not think you will find much better out there the cinematography is incredible the score by hans zimmer is beautiful the cast is good the script is good the idea is mind blowing lets have a more in depth view i love pace films and every scene in space i just watched in awe and was captivated the film catapults you into a different dimension and into a unique undiscovered world what more could you want i have heard a lot of comparisons being made to #### but i personally find interstellar far more engaging with being more emotionally involving rather than being slightly bored as when i watch #### the score by hans zimmer is wonderful and fits in with the film perfectly what more would you expect from the master though the cast is good i only say good and not great because i thought maybe someone else could have been more suited to the roles not that the cast was bad but a couple seemed like a safe bet mr nolan obviously has good relations with his cast as he uses them from other films he has done the couple of cast i maybe thought could have been better were anne hathaway and matt damon matt damon did a good job but i just did not get the idea why he was cast in this film it seemed a bit ridiculous and off putting and anne hathaway it seemed like she was a safe bet to me again she did the job but i thought why not try someone new as she was fresh out of the dark knight rises matthew mcconaughey was brilliant perfectly cast an actor with a new lease of life who seems very confident in what he is doing now jessica chastain was also brilliant as murphy beautifully played that goes for ms foy who played the younger murphy michael caine was his usual good self however i thought casey affleck could of maybe played his role slightly differently as his character seemed to turn psychotic towards the end the script a lot of people seem to be criticising the script i did not think the script was too bad yes it had a lot of exposition in it but it needed to unless you are clued up with science space and time but i also liked that the story was about love and mainly the love between a father and a daughter and finally the idea i loved the idea and was mesmerised by it the earth as we know it is coming to an end and we need to find somewhere new to live so they go on an adventure into outer space to find a new habitual planet where humans can live a big idea and a remarkable one too overall i score this film # the film is an incredible cinematic experience and is best watched at the cinema its a great achievement it was just a couple of off putting cast what lowered the mark ,10
91,EN,1664867938,many people will claim to be christopher nolan biggest fan so i will add myself to that list as a huge admirer of his work and to the group that cannot actually believe he has not won an oscar consequently my hopes are always sky high when it comes to his latest movie and when it came to inception while it took two views my hopes turned out conservative but we are here for interstellar when it emerged nolan next picture was to essentially turn his attention to space my trust was implicit in him that it would be something special and those hopes were realised but i will concede he has done even more special work than this interstellar sees mcconaughy retired naval pilot coop trapped in a borderline post apocalyptic earth of the near future where dust and blight are basically killing all crops and mankind with them the only way to save man is to find a new home and michael caine professor brand has a plan to achieve that but it will require coop to abandon his family including beloved daughter murph for an indeterminate period while the plan goes into action so just how good is interstellar plot wise it another which requires a couple of views to get the most out of it and while you will feel much more satisfied on that second viewing there will remain questions which come as a result of the topic space time travel and quantum mechanics are astounding topics to take on in cinema and nolan would never have been able to cover them all flawlessly it a fantastically compelling story which has created a massive world of intrigue within itself philosophical questions will abound for months years afterwards and those little plot holes probably only add to that directorally i would concede it is not his best piece of work some aspects here are a little muddled and not overly clear such a convoluted storyline was impossible to smooth over completely but cinematography wise it by far his best some of the cascading views you will see here in conjuction with the truly staggering special effects cgi the black hole and tsunamis are simply gorgeous are mesmerising and probably the best ever seen in cinema it is a slight pity in terms of plot that while it well known nolan made this his most personal and emotional film yet the themes of love do not truly convince in the way they are delivered a monologue anne hathaway brand gives reeks of nolan own opinion desperate to find a place for itself in this story and it does not work but the soundtrack does very different to inception and no less epic haunting or beautiful even if the same riffs and melodies tend to be reused a lot the acting mcconaughy muddy texan accent still struggles to make sense same trouble with true detective but that aside it entirely flawless from the entire cast and lastly the ending some will not be happy with it my issue with it was how abruptly it was delivered and how the mild flaws in overall direction led to it not being as coherent as it could have overall it is still a ## ## nolan is judged in different ways to mere mortal directors and the only one of his films i have not got as ## ## is insomnia itself a remake but it the weakest of his non batman movies still outstanding though ,10
92,EN,1664867938,i absolutely love space it is intriguing and curious to me this movie has that feeling and a great story line the acting from everyone was superior i am surprised this did not win more oscars the visual effects were top notch and i am impressed by the team that created them i also love christopher nolan other films like inception and the dark knight series some people say this is his best and i can support that i do not know what i have been doing for two years because i just watched this now in #### i had no idea what i was really getting into but it was totally worth it if you like science fiction and you have a knack for the unknown you should check this movie out definitely going into my favorites ,10
93,EN,1664867938,wowser this christopher nolan film was presaged with such marketing hype that i went in with pretty low and cynical expectations but i was frankly blown away with it just about everyone raves about christopher nolan work and you look back at his filmography and it makes for a pretty impressive resume from memento via the rather over hyped imho dark knight batman series reboot through to inception one of my favourite films of all time for me interstellar is right up there with inception for thought provoking visually spectacular and truly epic cinema we start in familiar would ay after tomorrow territory with mankind having in some way not entirely explained messed up the planet as i understood it and the film probably does require multiple watches with see comments below subtitles on the rather clever premise is that the world food supplies are being progressively destroyed by a vindictive blight this delivers the double whammy of destroying mankind provisions but also by massive reproduction of the organism progressively depleting the earth oxygen for some reason again which i did not get on first viewing this is accompanied by massive dust storms it is a morbid bet as to what is going to get the mid west population first starvation lung disease or suffocation matthew mcconnaughey plays the widowed cooper an ex nasa drop out turned farmer given the opportunity by mission leader professor brand an excellent michael caine to pilot a nasa mission the goal is to punch through a mysterious wormhole in space where they suspect through previous work that a new home for mankind could be found the first part of the film is set on and around cooper farm setting in place one of the emotional wrenches at the heart of the film that cooper in volunteering for the mission and having to leave behind his elderly father john lithgow again superb and young children murph aged ## and tom aged ## whilst recognising that danger for him comes not just from the inherent risks involved but from the theory of relativity that could change everything time wise for when he returns cooper is supported on the mission by a team of scientists including brand daughter played by a love struck anne hathaway who again shows she can act to say any more would spoil what is a voyage of visual and mental discovery however i would add that it is good to see that the character that plays my namesake dr mann in a surprise cameo is equally good looking lol in terms of plus points where do i start the visuals are utterly stunning whilst reminiscent in places of kubrick stargate from #### the similarity is only passing the film adds a majesty and scale to space that surpasses wonder elsewhere there are some interesting visual effects this might have just been me of course but after the dramatic launch there was something about the camera moves during the first scenes of weightlessness that made me feel genuinely nauseous equally stunning is hans zimmer score which is epic and in places very very loud the film certainly does not go quietly into the night when matching the noise of the score choir to the sound effects in the launch sequence the combination is ear bleedingly effective this must be a strong contender for the soundtrack oscar for #### one quibble again #### related is that zimmer uses the last chord of also sprach zarathustra in the score sufficiently often that one hopes richard strauss estate receives some royalties the acting is top notch i have already mentioned caine and lithgow but mcconnaughey hathaway and jessica chastain are all great a particular shout out should go to mackenzie foy as the young murph who is magnetically charismatic and just brilliant in the role above all nolan direction is exquisite the film has a slow build on earth which adds to the lengthy running time but defines the characters and primes the plot perfectly and some of the editing cuts again cooper farm departure launch sequence overlay is a great example are superb in building the mood and the tension i have decided that i am an extremely tough reviewer and for me a ## star film is a rarity indeed where i could have knocked off a star was in some of the dialogue on the soundtrack which was pretty inaudible in places mcconnaughey in particular with his general mumbling and strong southern accent is indecipherable in places i look forward to the dvd subtitles and one of the character dying words delivering a key plot point in the film was completely lost to me but thankfully later restated whilst the expansive plot is highly ambitious the end of the film playing fast and loose with physics i fear requires a gravity defying suspension of belief although i guess the same could equally be said of #### a space odyssey however the film has stayed so firmly lodged in my mind for ## hours i will make a rare exception to my rating rule overall this is a top notch sci fi film and a final word people this is a must see on the big screen if you enjoyed this review please see my archive of previous reviews at bob the movie man com and sign up for future notifications thanks ,10
94,EN,1664867938,i was blown away that was the absolute most fantastic spectacular goddamn beautiful movie i have ever seen in my entire life i did not even know movies were capable of being so powerful and moving the movie was so intricate and interconnected that you cannot help but be awe struck at how every detail comes together in the most perfect way the best part is that it was accurate and superb at visualizing all the science incorporated into the story and all the stretches made were based on real theories so nerdy people like me cannot be disillusioned by the fallacies that pop up in most movies you do not need to know much about science to enjoy the movie but it definitely reaches people who do on multiple levels at the end everyone in the audience was so speechless that people had trouble getting up and leaving the room if you have not already seen it please please please go see this movie you wo not regret it i do not know how anyone could go on in their lives without seeing it for themselves ,10
95,EN,1664867938,i am huge nolan fan but i am sorry interstellar will probably go down as his worst movie so far while the movie heart appears to be in the right place it always keeps reaching for something more than it is it has its moments but those moments are too few and even the fx looks a bit tacky especially coming so soon after gravity which had similar but superior fx i lost it and so will you at the point where anne hathaway character gives a long winded speech about how love transcends all dimensions of time and space i was not expecting a movie from the maker of inception to make a movie this corny ,5
96,EN,1664867938,this film tries to treat the topic of interstellar travel seriously unfortunately some ideas are presented according to our current knowledge of physics and astronomy while others are just stupid this mixture makes the suspension of disbelief necessary to enjoy such movie impossible to attain on one side we have wormholes black holes higher dimensions of space and the silence of the void on the other hand there is totally unconvincing reality of the xxi century where farmers are more valuable than engineers guys really and tomography is mysteriously gone in one scene the physicist explains convincingly the work regime of the wormhole by the way this scene is identical to the one from the far better event horizon in another we see the mission robot tars being the member of the crew i know that humanoid machines from fifties seem ridiculous today like the one from the day the earth stood still but they are really the top quality idea compared to the robots depicted in interstellar it is difficult to believe someone created such a model and the whole crew agreed to put it the picture it almost like the the wooden planet from the initial script of alien # the number of errors and non logical events is just amazing anyone complaining about the lack of consistency in prometheus which was also much better than this one will have the real hunting ground here in fact the more time passes after seeing the movie the more nonsenses are detected do not think about this too much anyway its not worthy the nolan brothers used their imagination a little bit too much in the final part of the story where the word magic interchangeable with nonsense comes to mind as the result the viewer is left at the end indifferent to what is presented on the screen and does not care about the fate of the characters please recall the infamous black hole and you will have the impression of what is going on here the music is of course the extremely important part of every picture if the composer knows his craft the soundtrack complements the images creating the flawless combo as was in terminator starship troopers aliens etc here we have the attempt to create the epic atmosphere but the events shown on screen are rather uninteresting therefore the resulting impression is just the overwhelming noise making the viewer angry instead of touching or moving him ,6
97,EN,1664867938,just to let you all know this is not a review but my imaginative interpretation of this epic mastermind just an imagination so that everyone can understand the ending my love for the film made me imagine this forget all about the wormhole even the black hole for a minute consider there was no hope and humanity was to end with all other life forms everyone died now after years life emerged again on earth now there are # cases here case # the humans would be like us # d they will learn what we learned and be the same as us case # the humans would figure out time space gravity etc and they would surpass the third dimension consider case # happened they got to know all about the black hole figured out time travel they placed a wormhole to travel other galaxies now somehow the wormhole triggered a time alteration i e a part of it reflected the past now both the world past and present existed simultaneously they were parallel the worlds never collided both existed with the wormhole being constant i e the people of the past could access the hole now consider this a switch case program in java or c if case # ever existed a reality was created in which it was meant that it will always be cooper who would fall into the black hole this event was bound to happen every time case # would take place now the future beings never wanted to alter the past they had no idea that their wormhole was triggered in the past too so cooper went and collected the data to murph and eventually she would decode it learn of the dimensions and gravity so the event when cooper fell and transmitted the data is taking place constantly in this event since case # took place even when cooper was in murph room that event was in loop where he would save humanity but the loop was not complete since murph was a child and she would be the one to receive the code this was also a fixed event if case # took place it will always be murph who would receive it so as she was a child that loop was continuous the event kept happening but was incomplete because their ages did not match so the loop kept happening until the ctr pause break was murph age she aged in earth and matched his father as soon as she aged bang the loop was complete and she finally received the data now after receiving it the past beings were saved and so the parallel world broke and only one world existed from that incident i e the past humans it changed the future i e there was no future beings only we existed and learned all about gravity the black hole part is a reality metaphor for the afterlife future beings personifies afterlife who are the ones who see time and gravity as a physical dimension as soon as the loop was complete the future ceased to exist which is why it collapsed on itself cooper immediate afterlife ceased to exist ,9

99,EN,-186562973,this movie is simply brilliant it is filled with beutiful cinematography and touching themes the soldiers are human humans struggling with harsh aspects of war the narrations provide great insights into the characters and the flashbacks make there backgrounds seem real the best war movie since das boot in my mind i have seen it three times now and will probably go to see it once for sure possibly twice more an excellent film and my pick for best picture director ,10
100,EN,1176321638,while we are treated with great set designs and dark moody lighting as well as a great cast at least on paper this movie will fail to enjoy the average moviegoer or anyone else who goes to the movies to see something original or somewhat surprising or sensible for that matter as others have pointed out this movie was basically cut in two with a dreadfully slow and rather uneventful first hour and a somewhat more pacey last half far too many scenes were much longer than was necessary and often annoyed me as yet another ten minutes passed and nothing worthy of note happened i also have to comment on the most of the time incredibly weak script and laboured acting although the two cannot really be judged separately by many of the actors who tried to portray a culture which was clearly not their own i also thought that the constant switching between english and russian in the dialog was pretty annoying as it has always been in films it only made the characters even more stereotypical than they frankly already were i kept wondering why they did not simply get a russian cast i also did not think the story to be very original or otherwise memorable with a premise which once again in a movie fully relied on an unreal amount of naivety on the part of the protagonist and the viewer who was thus suiting the character played by a female blond the ever so gorgeous naomi watts what a horrible clich the plottwist was lame and insipid also the ending left me feeling terribly disappointed as it simply did not make a whole lot of sense and also one that looked suspiciously like a set up for yet another even more insipid sequel do not be hoodwinked by the lionizing reviews that dub this movie on par with movies like the godfather or goodfellas it not even a matter of personal opinion whether it ranks with these cinematic giants or not common sense and some perspective will tell you it does not every movie you will look up here on imdb no matter how bad will have reviews calling it the best film ever made or this year best as you will find them here as well the big fat # this movie scores here on imdb is nothing more than proof that this website has become more and more overpopularised or has been taken advantage of by film studio companies who flood this site and inflate the polling to sell their products one should question imdb policies on this for it will surely be the end of this website if they cannot figure out a proper defense against it soon in short unremarkable little movie that is certainly not for the average moviegoer who will probably only switch off their interest somewhere during the first half hour and hope they can still get their money back which will be their second disappointment of the evening ##,1
101,EN,1488879213,this black and white ##s noir homage to james m cain relates the story of a barber thornton who blackmails his wife lover mcdormand as the wife and gandolfini as the lover to buy into a partnership with polito to start a dry cleaners his ambitions simply have no limit the remainder of the film charts the consequences of that action a subplot also has him trying to encourage his friend schoolgirl daughter to success as a musician so that he can manage her like cain novels the film is about ordinary people doing extraordinary things and usually losing whilst it has similarities with fargo in terms of subject matter and miller crossing in terms of setting dialogue and style it has important differences despite the thrillerish plot it deliberately avoids moving quickly or suspensefully instead it concentrates on the slow and stupid thoughts and movements of the main character and thus moves more slowly than you would expect from the premise into an ever downward spiral the subplot though largely superfluous to the main plot does accentuate the loser streak in thornton and manages a quick homage with a twist to lolita at the same time the highlights are the photography the acting especially from thornton gandolfini and tony shalhoub as a shyster defence lawyer and on the whole the plot however great though this film is it not as good as my personal coen brother favourites fargo and miller crossing one of the problems was the slow pace although i appreciate that this was intentional and i was in a cinema without air conditioning on a hot night also the pace is explained with a good joke at the end of the film more problematic are the plot holes surrounding the trial scenes towards the end of the film that slightly spoil the ending in all however an excellent film and better than either o brother where art thou or big lebowski ,10

104,EN,1361284206,i found the film to be utter rubbish the sherlock holmes character was more like a cross between steven seagal and mcgyver and unshaven he did not look intelligent when he was trying to solve problems his pipe was not right and some of his shirts i wondered if they really existed before #### and of course his accent was not quite right the english accent or rather english accents can be difficult to achieve and ends up as a mishmash of different regional accents i find myself trying to sort out which regions and that spoils the film for me as for irene adler at first i thought the american accent incorrect but then realised that conan doyle had her born in new jersey in #### so she would have been around ## at the middle of the construction of tower bridge the french speaking thugs had a french canadian accent strange i agree that the special effects seemed to have been bought from a charity shop all the buildings scenes seemed not right not real if you cannot get it right do not put it in and all the chase scenes not very sherlock holmes esquire were nothing to do with what i had expected as were the last second saves in the pig abattoir the amount of violence was far greater than ever seen before in previous renderings of the great detective i concluded that it should have been given another name e g herlock sholmes the parody invented by maurice leblanc in his ars ne lupin books conan doyle was apparently annoyed that just about sums it up it was not sherlock holmes it was a parody ,2
105,EN,1361284206,i give it a # because it still a good time waster but not at current prices it really a shame that when basil rathbone was playing holmes universal studios did not give the series an a picture budget and reduced the series to a b picture status unlike the first two holmes watson movies from ##th cent fox in #### namely hound of the baskervilles and adventures of sherlock holmes this latest attempt is yet another modern example of tens of millions spent on special effects but not enough money spent on a good story or proper actors btw the only other holmes that ever met the standard of rathbone version was the bbc tv series that starred the late jeremy brett this one with downey wait for it to come out on video or appear on cable save your money ,3
106,EN,1812626543,tl dr gravity is a good film with some incredible visual scenes sandra bullock cannot act worth spit long gravity is better than i thought it was going to be some great space scenes shots of the earth etc would look incredible on imax basically some astronauts get into serious trouble and have to struggle to survive and make it back to earth has some seriously great sfx scenes and few slower moments but it never feels like it drags luckily the script is packed with disasters so it manages to move along at a brisk pace without ruining the feel of space as a vast endless well space it essentially a one actor film sandra bullock with a supporting role george clooney unfortunately bullock acting is so uneven that it almost ruins the film for example during the initial disaster moment she terrified and understandably so her character is not an experienced astronaut and it a disaster of unimaginable proportions however this terror vanishes soon after even when faced with other serious disasters whilst you do not want a character that a useless terrified blob the whole film the complete unevenness of her acting is bizarre the end result is that the majority of the film lacks a lot of tension and that sucks things go wrong and she just takes it all in her stride there just no emotion there except for the obligatory finding the will to survive scene overall a great film well directed gorgeous cinematography well sfx but well composed some great tense scenes definitely a big screen film # out of ## ,8
107,EN,1812626543,i am not a big fan of space film but i really enjoyed gravity cuaron film is short and intense and the viewer is always attracted by the story even when it is a bit slow especially in same situation after the tragic accident the best thing in my opinion is the fantastic interpretation of clooney and bullock who can truly win the oscars for best supporting actor e best actress in a leading role especially sandra bullock with her particular and difficult role in which the actress is often alone on the scene i would not be surprised if she will double her prize for the blind side talking about the film one of the best moments is in the final when cuaron has the brilliant idea to represent the evolution first sandra bullock swim in the sea according to many scientist first cellular forms lived in the water then she goes out having a quadrupedal position and finally she stands erect like modern man my rating for a film that could be a big protagonist at the oscars is # ## ,8
108,EN,1812626543,sandra bullock is in the womb space labor pains happen which cause her to to leave the womb toward mother earth the scene when she lands in the water and struggles to to get to oxygen is her entering this world notice how she kisses the beach as if it her mothers bosom and how she struggles to walk and has such appreciation for life because she just came so close to death she is born again such a good movie i love the suspense and graphics my favorite scene is when she is comforted by the lullaby there is a lot of motion going on in the beginning the only bad thing i can say about this movie is that it can get you motion sick so do not watch this movie if you are hungover ,8
109,EN,1812626543,gravity is the most creatively genius film of our time alfonso cuar n challenges the entire industry to make original films truly magnificent cuar n decides to compose the film from a series of incredibly long takes because of this it is nearly impossible to not be captivated the camera lens essentially becomes the audience perspective causing viewers to look on as if they were drifting throughout space with the characters in the film a truly intimate choice for cinematography that is executed brilliantly cuar n takes a great risk with not only making a ## minute film but essentially conveying that the film is a true minute to minute ratio of what the audience is actually seeing the story clearly takes place over a several hour time period but is conveyed as if what the audience is watching is real time with the exception of a handful of jump cuts cuar n takes a bold move and succeeds in essentially tricking the audience and changing their sense of time to further entrance the viewers there is only one critique i can give the film the visuals were so beautiful innovative magnificent and close to perfection than any movie ever made that the emotional dialogue literally could not keep up with the visuals during the scenes where dialogue is supposed to hit the film themes home with the audience it simply cannot though the themes are still very simple and obvious they are not as powerful as cuar n intended them to be the audience was probably predicted to cry aloud during some line deliveries by bullock but could not due to the fact that they were still in complete shock at what they just witnessed gravity is a combination of modern technology and classic story gravity is a testimony that original films still exist brilliant ,9
110,EN,1812626543,this is a great movie specially in #d the effects are excellent and lines are well delivered the script is good too without being mawkish it has so many hairy moments and the director really makes you feel you are right there in the space suit when bullock is scrambling along the outside of the chinese space station with no tether my butt cheeks were firmly clenched i really got the sense that the director had thought about what space is like the quiet the vastness and the vulnerability of humans is space suits definitely for the si fi fan and not too much for the sloppy romantic enthusiast i would say it has the feel of #### apollo ## mission to mars and that genre but better and more up to date enjoy ,9
111,EN,1812626543,boy i am glad i downloaded this movie instead of buying it after all the hype around it even on this website it is currently rated at # ## stars i would have thought it was the best movie of #### but as i began to watch the film i started wondering how on earth no pun intended this movie could have possible been nominated for accolades such as best picture and best director the first thing that struck out to me were the physical impossibilities rampant throughout the film ryan the protagonist flies off of the space arm and spins off into space yet somehow a mere ten seconds later her spin has slowed considerably or what about how the parachute opens later in the movie in space that is impossible perhaps the biggest fault in the movie was simply how unlikely the entire plot was a chunk of debris is flying around the earth at # miles per second no way can you spot that with your naked eye and no way each and every satellite and space station orbiting the earth just happens to orbit along the same path no way ryan would be able to move from one space station to another no way my biggest complaint with the film was how emotional unstable ryan was how did she manage to get selected to go into space with only six months of training and a recently deceased daughter for the amount of hysterics and silly monologue viewers must endure one can only come to the conclusion that ryan is not suitable for being an astronaut and would have never been chosen in the first place to end on a positive note the graphics were quite good like most other reviews claim i was impressed with the space stations and the depiction of earth in conclusion do not waste your time on this so called greatest space movie of all time ,2
112,EN,1812626543,this story was well written there are a large amount of positives with this film but this film is shockingly overrated maybe its because of some form of film patriotism from the u s george clooney and sandra bullock americas sweethearts as amazing as they were in this movie there is no way that this should have a meta score rating of ## with however many hundreds of awards including # oscars fun fact pretty well ## of this movie is animated i am just in utter confusion as to why people find this amazing if you want a good space movie about overcoming odds go watch tom hanks in apollo ## this on the other hand is quite average with so much focus on the negative people may be wondering why i gave it a # out of ## well as i said before there are a lot of positives most of which are produced by the acting skills of clooney and bullock nevertheless i do not think i would ever watch this movie ever again ,7

115,EN,-16449932,after two brief scenes that at first seem unrelated to the rest of the film we see a dark haired obviously rich beauty in the back of a limousine her driver stops at an odd location on mulholland drive which is a twisting thickly wooded two lane road full of mansions overlooking los angeles just as her driver and another man in the passenger seat turn around to kill her two drag racing cars from the opposite direction come crashing into the limo only the dark haired woman survives she works her way down the ridge to sunset boulevard and hides in a vacationing woman apartment shortly after betty naomi watts the vacationing woman niece shows up at the apartment and runs into the dark haired woman who now has amnesia the bulk of the first part of the film is betty and the dark haired woman trying to figure out who she is why people were trying to kill her and why she had thousands of dollars and a strange key in her purse this is interspersed with oddly surreal threads about hollywood producers and directors with occasional forays into a land of hoodlums and prostitutes the above may sound a bit complicated and disjointed but that not the half of it the film is constructed so that the meaning will always be open to interpretation it basically guaranteed that you will not understand this film and you will not have very much confidence arriving at your own interpretation the first time around even if you have a lot of experience with like minded films such as memento #### donnie darko #### the i inside #### and the butterfly effect #### you may not understand it on a second viewing either the studio was aware of this to the extent that they had director david lynch write ## clues to unlocking this thriller and they put it on the back of the chapter listing insert in the dvd lynch being of a particular disposition these clues are almost as cryptic as the film itself it does not help when trying to figure it out in the early stages that the structure is extremely complex it takes a very long time to figure out what parts are supposed to be real and there is a complex nesting of flashbacks in some sections with only contextual clues that they are flashbacks but is the film worth watching or worth trying to figure out that depends on your tastes obviously on a surface level the film is certainly attractive if you are a fan of surrealism although it will tend to seem a bit slow and overly disjointed to some viewers but those qualities and many other surrealist aspects of the film are typical of lynch a prime lynchian moment is the old couple in the beginning bizarrely smiling almost as if they are alien pod people trying to put on a front if you are familiar with that style and like it you will find much to love here although in many ways mulholland drive is fairly understated for lynch it also worth noting for viewers who will primarily be interested in it or who enjoy it just as much as other aspects that mulholland drive has a quite steamy lesbian scene it not gratuitous although i have no problems with gratuitousness but is instead an important hinge in the film like all of lynch films it easy to become enraptured in his unique approach to every aspect of filmic art and his attention to detail any serious student of film including armchair students cinephiles should study mulholland drive many will love it lynch does not let anything pass unmanipulated he includes brilliant color schemes such as the plethora of reds and pinks with important symbolism he makes unusual use of sound such as the ringing telephone carrying over into the section of score that follows it when betty first arrives at the airport he directs his actors to deliver their lines in a plethora of bizarre ways such as his characteristic odd pauses he lets his odd and surprising sense of humor poke through such as the name winkie and the hot dogs made for pinks sign that provides a clue to some of the color symbolism lynch attention to detail in production design provides important subtle clues throughout the film to help one unlock the meaning it interesting to note that lynch even apparently demands that the dvd programming be unusual there are no chapters on the disc you must either watch the film in real time or fast forward or rewind to get back to particular points if the surrealism and veiled meaning of the film are attractive to you or if you are just fond of puzzles then mulholland drive is well worth watching for that aspect there is a fairly accepted interpretation of the film at least on a broad generalized level i wo not recount the standard interpretation here it is worth researching but only after you have seen the film a couple times and have reached your own conclusions many articles and monographs have been written on the film and interpretations there are even websites dedicated to it for my money however although i generally love lynch and find many things about mulholland drive attractive it is not quite a ## for me at least not yet i have a feeling that my score could still rise on subsequent viewings to me though the twist aspect of the film is done much better in other works such as the i inside and the butterfly effect mulholland drive is more attractive to me for its surface surrealistic touches but the plot does not carry them as well as some of lynch other films still mulholland drive is certainly recommended for the right crowd if you are serious about film and do not mind having to think about what you watch as if those two would not necessarily coincide you should not miss this one ,8
116,EN,-16449932,this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen it makes me sad that there are people that think this movie was better than empire of the sun or sling blade or forest gump or stand by me or good will hunting this film was absurd junk i am sorry if that impresses you when people are able to purposefully write logic less films the sad part is that the absurdity was only added as an afterthought the entire first half of the film was written as a pilot for tv and the first part was great i would have hoped it would have made it after it did not make it though throw in a lesbian encounter and some female masturbation then contradict the sub plots of the first portion of the movie i would have been much more impressed had the second half tied up everything that the first half started and a lot of movies nowadays do not do this again one of the most pathetic movies that i have ever seen ,1

118,EN,-16449932,although this movie revolves around the characters of betty elms and rita there is also the character of the director adam kesher whom i think david lynch has modeled on himself who plays an important role here this entire film is an indictment of what is wrong with hollywood the vultures that adam kesher has to deal with in order to get his work produced and the whole illusion of hollywood that swallows up young innocents like betty elms who end up not even knowing who they are anymore after a few weeks in town all in all this a fun movie to watch with some very dark elements certainly not lynch best work he has tackled the battle between good and evil to better effect in films like blue velvet but still an interesting mystery that sort of kind of resolves itself at the end except it really does not ,10
119,EN,-16449932,there is an inherent problem with commenting or reviewing a film such as this i remember feeling the same way after disliking dogma if you do not like a film that is odd and controversial like mulholland dr you are seen as not getting it of course for those who have already seen this film you know that the entire point is not getting it anyway i have heard from several different sources that the unique and likable aspect of this film is a dream like quality it has in other words the plot is not structured like other films with the case of mulholland dr it seems more like an unfocused collage made by a third grade boy who procrastinated until the last second to do his art project it does not make sense it is not supposed to but i know it was to be a tv series at first it appears lynch had a stack of unused film and decided to mash it in with a bunch of new stuff you will notice that toward the end the nudity sex and foul language increase all things he would not have filmed for television for a better film not told in a traditional linear fashion rent the thin red line from #### that was a great film this is not rating # out of ten,2
120,EN,-1687525771,avatar unveils the saddest picture of film critics in decades in order to praise this shallow #d unimaginative generic world the majority of respected and experienced critics had to throw down the toilet all their previous film education so they could hold the candle in the dark while cameron performs an additional lobotomy on the already over lobotomized audience the hypnotized general audience will always bow under the burden of the pompous constant direct pr attacks of the studios but that where the critics should stand their ground now it seems their ground is as big as pandora in short the worst outcome of avatar is a massive self ridicule of the critics that puts them right where they belong down the toilet ,1
121,EN,-1687525771,if special effects were the essence of movie making cameron fantasy avatar might have been a film of value however this movie amazes the viewer with the complete lack of original ideas in its story telling we have almost half a billion dollars spent on a cheesy story padded with political correctness and an annoying imposition of some mixture of neo paganism spiritualist environmentalism and wicca goddess worship the preaching of the weird religious beliefs is in your face and relentless besides the time spent on rituals and chanting we even have a conversion scene of a hard scientist to the religion of the planet natives and these navi beliefs are good old jungle boogie mixed up with some mother earth nonsense freakshow the natives of the planet are humanoid yet not exactly human besides taking you into another world the choice of the race for the natives is quite offensive they are a bigger version of humans with some elf like features vampire fangs and the facial expressions of an ant eater we should not forget the proverbial tail evolution has taken its own turn on the planet the special visuals may make entering this world of cameron unobtrusive but the sense of mixing these creatures with humans is still unnerving to the viewer and let not forget the color blue for the skin is only a little step away from the usual green gray color of aliens the bad guys are the white males of military discipline and corporate greed the good guys are the tribal planetary humanoid underdogs and the breakaway humans sympathizing with the native cause the story telling is good as it follows the classical secrets of the trade but the sheer length of it and the indulgence in special visuals makes it rather boring and lacking depth borrowing from other movies is heavy in it we sense the strain of cameron imagination to overcome its boundaries set by his own liking experience and pretensions the film is a mixture which borrows from the matrix entering another world through a heavily wired coffin apocalypto kill the beast but apologize after all it is your brother count dracula the native have protruding fangs star wars much shooting on a large scale in a strange planetary environment the glimmer man with steven segal bad bad company digging for treasure under my house dances with wolves i must become one of them aliens is also present some of the animals open their nasty mouths in the same way as the main beast of that movie this is an annoying and preachy film which thanks to the enormous budget and mass marketing has become yet another blockbuster symbol of human moral and intellectual limitations good movies are not just special effects wrapped up in new age spirituality but who am i to say that to the king of the world ,1

123,EN,-1687525771,watch this movie for the visual effects not the story it disney pocahontas all over again only this time john smith quite magically turns into an indian at the end instead of going back to england puhleeze the story line makes me want to gag three d is cool if you see it in # d you will not be impressed by anything in this movie more often than not aliens are evil conquerors and this movie is no exception to that rule it is not usual but not original either that the humans are the aliens here and true to that sort of plot line the evil conquerors have just a couple dissidents who foil the evil plan help the hopeless victims and become the heroes of the story they would have done better by having some meddling kids become the heroes but even that could not have saved this story line and of course the environmentalist movement now has yet another movie in which nature is divine and humans are a plague that needs to be expelled too bad the producers could not have spent more on getting good writers ,1
124,EN,-1687525771,i knew the plot was going to be similar to battle for terra which might have stolen james cameron concept in the first place but ten minutes into the film its sheer visual force made me forget all that i agree with the reviewer from spain who commented that you have seen this story a hundred times in place of the blue skinned ten foot aliens with tails i kept seeing native americans from the last of the mohicans and dances with wolves in sam worthington turn as a hero gone over to the other side i kept seeing daniel day lewis and kevin costner from the said films and during the end credits i realized wes studi from those two films also had a part in it it even reminded me a bit of the last samurai this was not exactly a setback cos i was not expecting big plot twists anyway one of the things i enjoyed most was sigourney weaver return as cameron heroine though decidedly mellower the feisty grace shares a lot in common with aliens ripley character wise kudos to jim cameron for having the heroic heroine smoke i am not a smoker myself but i am tired of hollywood only villains smoke clich i also enjoyed stephen lang villainous turn but is it just me or does he start looking more alien than the aliens themselves toward the end of the film in spite of having no major plot twists i admired the way cameron handled the character arcs of some of the secondary characters like f i giovanni ribisi character who starts out more or less seeming like paul riser soulless yuppie in aliens but surprises us a bit when he starts showing some conscience ,1

128,EN,-1687525771,the creation of a brand new unique world in avatar is nothing less than spectacular clearly the film should get oscars for visual effects and art direction unfortunately the story is dry trite and predictable i spent the last ## minutes checking the time and waiting impatiently for the number one bad guy and the number one good guy to fight it out with the good guy winning of course and for our hero to get transferred into his na vi body the dialogue was flat and and the acting painfully wooden hundreds of millions and they cannot give us better writing and acting but the biggest disappointment for me was the plot once again we are told that the only answer to violence is more violence if even the peaceful na vi cannot find alternative responses to aggression what hope do the rest of us have what a golden opportunity to show a fresh nonviolent response that could have inspired us all to find peaceful solutions in our own life of course that would not have appealed to the ## year old boys who have hijacked hollywood films violence and big budget battle scenes have become essential money rules we have become inured to violence in our world and see it as the only possible answer but as gandhi wrote an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind should not film directors and writers take every opportunity to inspire as well as entertain even films made just to entertain inevitably instruct by the examples shown by their plot choices so yawn once again we learn that the only response to violence is more violence that we have myriad examples of this kind of response in life is no excuse peaceful solutions can only come about when we believe they are possible ,6
129,EN,-1687525771,well i just got home from seeing avatar in #d it was an entertaining film but it was also so much less than it could have been visually and technologically it was superb the plot however was derivative and hackneyed overall it was the movie equivalent of a pop tart colorful and yummy but lacking real substance but hey sometimes i like a good pop tart as i watched i had a nagging feeling that it all seemed vaguely familiar then it hit me ferngully this is ferngully for grownups although visually the film was in #d from a plot standpoint the characters were very two dimensional the military guys are with two exceptions all stereotypical thugs the scientists are all thoughtful and benevolent the corporate guy is greedy and crass the na vi natives are noble savages all of the characters fit into simple and cartoon like categories so we know who to cheer for and who to boo at the ending wraps up everything nice and neat and tidy for us the theological world of the noble na vi is one of insipid new agey pantheism which seemed to have been cribbed from disney pocahontas the plants and animals and trees and na vi are all interconnected in an environmentally friendly web of eco consciousness or something like that i half expected to hear elton john singing the circle of life on the other hand religion did not even appear to be on the radar screen of the human characters the concept of a personal transcendent deity was nowhere in sight the macguffin of the film is a rare and valuable mineral called i kid you not unobtainium other than being described as the motivator for the human rapacious conquest of the na vi planet it is given no further explanation why do the humans need unobtainium so badly i assumed that at some point it would come into play perhaps to provide a key twist or revelation but it turned out to be nothing more than an element to drive the plot the most disappointing thing about avatar was that cameron relied on the tried and true mechanism of having the characters use violence to resolve the film conflicts walter wink in his fantastic book the powers that be calls this the myth of redemptive violence i was hoping for something more profound and thought provoking but ultimately it came down to guns and knives and rockets and arrows and grenades and spears and big explosions and various people dying in entertaining ways some have said that avatar carries an anti war message yet it is war that was presented as the only solution to the conflict between the na vi and the humans the underdog na vi win the battle the humans go home end of story of course if they make a sequel and it follows the history of the american indians upon which the na vi are obviously based the humans will just return with a larger army and finish the job it would have been so much more interesting if the enlightened na vi and their spiritually intelligent planet could have come up with a more creative and redemptive way to teach us naughty humans a lesson so there you have it ferngully meets pocahontas but with more weaponry and a much bigger budget a movie with a very similar plot line but better written and with a more satisfying ending is the lovely animated film battle for terra if you liked avatar go rent battle for terra ,7
130,EN,-1687525771,i thought the story itself was not original but the cinematography and the visuals especially if you watch it in #d absolutely mind blowing i also think that the message is one that should be heard unfortunately we do not have that special physical link to our world like the na vi and we are doing exactly like the humans in the movie destroying our planet for profit maybe this film will be more than just a film and maybe people will look at pandora beautiful people and environment and realize that we do have that here and we could have more not as much though and not as big and although there is not a physical link there is one of life between us and our earth and we are killing ourselves i doubt there will be an avatar # because the story would be something like this humans come back multiplied like cockroaches with more guns and more firepower and they do destroy the beautiful world of pandora for profit the end for everything i have lost faith in the people ability to see beyond what is right in front of them and although i am hoping for it i doubt that this film will open eyes otherwise avatar gets a ## ## from me ,8
131,EN,-1687525771,i give this film a # out of ## just because it was so fantastic to watch in #d enthralling mind blowing emotional and there are not many films where the end credits roll and the audience starts clapping however there are two things that bug me about this film and it is not the military general that you truly hate despise and would love to see his guts painfully strewn everywhere no it is character development i feel like i was emotionally attached to the aliens as a species and i felt nothing for the humans i do not know if it was the cast but i did not find any particular character i liked or felt for or rooted for thankfully the emotional context was high enough to compensate for that sam worthington did not particularly impress me the other thing was the fact that a few weeks ago i saw the film battle for terra which coincidentally had almost the same plot humans invade planet to get what they want they cannot breathe there and are willing to destroy an alien species to get what they want the politicians scientists want to negotiate and the military wants to dominate of course one human soldier is taken in by the aliens and is forced to take sides both films are different in look and back story yet similar in context both are good sound familiar ,9

133,EN,-1687525771,i love this movie the story line is awesome the acting is top notch and the cg work is cutting edge i do not understand why so many people want to bash this flic if anything i would say it was the best sci fi flick of the new century i really glad james cameron had the foresight to wait till the tech had caught up to make the film the only thing of the movie that did not set well with me was the part where tsu tey was beating down the merc on the rear of the cargo hold the last one ends up dumping a magazine worth of rounds in his chest and knocks him off the ship i understand a lot of people do not know about firearms i do the caliber of the gun the merc was using was a # ##mm ### the na vi are ruffly # times the size of humans to get that affect on tsu tey you would need a gun that shot a # ## cal with around #### lbs from the barrel of the firearm a gun that no human could carry or control with out mounted no way fired from the shoulder the ### round would of hit him like a poke from your finger and been like hit with the point of a ballpoint pen i understand that their is point of theatrics cool but that is the only problem i have with this gem of cinema ,10
134,EN,1268335734,this movie is a beautiful film with great actors and great cinematography you can hate clint eastward or love him does not matter because this film is a great movie by itself clint eastwood is great but this film stands alone as one of the best clint eastwood is a wonderful director and producer this movie is for everyone it will make you cheer and also reflect but at most it makes you appreciate clint eastwood work gran torino is a movie of why a role model or a father figure can mean so much why learning from your past can haunt you or help you that everyone can be friends evan if their past do not go so great that a man should always stand up for what is right and always defend the people they keep closest gran torino is hands down one of the best films i have seen ,9
135,EN,1268335734,clint eastwood rocks by not letting his ## years get the best out of him he still delivers a killer punch on the big screen gran torino is a poignant story about love life friendships and above all decisions choices how our decisions affect us and others and how choices others make affect and perhaps even change us what also is great about this film is that though it keeps the audience engaged from the very start is does so as a comedy satire whilst the drama builds up as the story unfolds all the way to its tragic climax keep them coming clint,10
136,EN,-156915351, warning spoilers enclosed this movie came out around the same time as platoon and i made the mistake of seeing platoon first after sitting through that garbage pretending to be a movie i decided that a i was not ever going to get the time back and b i was done with viet nam movies so it was my misfortune that i had to wait until after this movie came out on video and i had a raging case of influenza before anyone could get me in the same room as this was being shown it may have been the nyquil or it could have been the other non prescription cold remedies that did it but i actually laughed so much at this movie i almost puked okay so i sobered up and watched it again a while later did not take me a while to sober up just to watch it again and the funny thing was that i enjoyed it as much the second time after i was able to hear the parts i roared with laughter at the first time i watched everyone has said something positive about r lee ermey performance and i am not going to be different i did not think it was possible to hear so much invective from one man in one sentence and keep a straight face and even as jaded as i am i can only look on in wonder and admiration at the passion he put into his part quick synopsis bunch of kids from all over the usa are sent to parris island for marine training most of them get through it they go to viet nam and some of em die and if that was all the movie was about it would still be a reasonable flick watching the characters develop deciding who to hate and who to like listening to r lee ermey here you are all equally worthless and were you born worthless or did you have to work at it and finally seeing them become marines were all very entertaining but this was only the under card for the main event viet nam of course through all the death destruction and carnage all around we were still treated to moments that were so on the dark side they were actually hilarious papillon soo was our introduction to joker life in country and apart from the much quoted attempts to pick up the g i me love you long time she was actually one of the most poised and least forced looking of the cast but even her appearance has a nasty undercurrent that took me two viewings to see the black humor is more prevelent as the movie gets toward the end and there are moments of pure madness that are so obscenely ridiculous they are probably closer to the truth than the more acceptable scenes but probably the funniest lines of all are from the second section of this movie you know there not a single horse in the entire country of vietnam there definitely something wrong with that and the ever colourful animal mother ideas on patriotism if i am gonna get my balls blown off for a word my word is poontang all in all this was funny disgusting sad hilarious sickening and moving all the things a great movie should be the final scene however was probably the most poignant of any war film made in a very long time a bunch of kids with rifles marching through devastation singing and whistling the theme to the mickey mouse show we always revert to that which is most comfortable in times of greatest stress and for this movie to end any other way would have weakened it to the levels of platoon and tour of duty ,10
137,EN,94508664,i watched the preview screening of this hosted by sky this film is fantastic for all the family i enjoyed it as much as most of the children that were in the screening it was really nice to hear them all laughing and that made us laugh more there were a couple of jokes in the film which only applied to the adults and you could hear the adults laugh but no children it was really funny there were jokes that stood out and we talked about after we left the cinema the plot was also good and easy to follow and i did not notice any points where it got slow all the characters were great particularly the minions its the best #d film i have seen so far all in all a great film for everyone ,7
138,EN,1194680953,the hit broadway play by frederick knott dial m for murder has been adapted to the screen several times including the films made in west germany and sweden as well as a tv movie in #### tv by boris seagal and the film a perfect murder #### directed by andrew davis with michael douglas gwyneth paltrow and viggo mortensen alfred hitchcock #### adaptation was the first and certainly the best one even if the master himself considered it one of his lesser efforts dial m for murder will be remembered as hitchcock first color film and the first of three thrillers he had made with grace kelly the future princess of monaco in the prime of her beauty and her talent using color proved to be very effective in the film the first two scenes featuring kelly wearing a white morning dress in the idyllic scene with her husband tony and right after that kissing passionately her american lover writer robert cummings in the red dress immediately without many words tell the viewer that the story of passion deception betrayal and ultimately murder will follow ray milland tony wendice is a surprisingly sympathetic villain which is perhaps not surprising from the actor with talent charm and charisma that equal and remind a lot of both cary grant and jimmy stewart who knows about his wife cheating and decides to teach her a lesson by plotting a very clever murder which will make him a sole heir to her money she is a wealthy one in the family his plan is perfect and almost works but margot managed to not only escape the murderer but to turn the table on him while stunned wendice is on the phone and listens how his well thought of plan collapses wendice is very resourceful and he proved to be a master of improvisation because it took him a few minutes in a cab to switch to a plan b that turned a terrified victim margot into a cold blooded murderess now it is up to seasoned and shrewd inspector hubbard john williams to find the crucial piece of evidence and to solve the case as always with hitchcock his directing is impeccable the camera rarely leaves wendice apartment but the film is never claustrophobic which is the case for many plays adaptation it breathes and moves freely and we almost forget that we are in the same room for close to two hours i would not call dial m for murder my favorite hitchcock film but it is enjoyable clever and witty thriller with the interesting twists outstanding performances and more than one truly memorable scenes ,8
139,EN,1194680953,ray milland as a man who devises a plan to have a college associate kill his wife grace kelly for her inheritance and the fact that she had an affair is a pleasure to watch in a role that seems almost tailor made for his emoting he is just as effective as maurice evans was on the stage alfred hitchcock has taken frederick knott play from a screenplay written by knotts himself and carefully built the suspense to the point where a clever mastermind is exposed the business with the key is extremely effective and the lynch pin that destroys the husband alibi grace kelly is smooth but rather bland as the wife a role offered first to olivia de havilland whose salary demands were too high and robert cummings has a rather conventional supporting role as the man she really loves but it anthony dawson as the college chum who agrees to murder kelly and john williams as the fastidious detective who solves the case that really remain in the memory among the more interesting hitchcock films of this period it the sort of detective yarn any mystery fan would enjoy ,7
140,EN,1425373818,i just do not gettit why do people like this movie why even bother making such a huge gigantic pile of poop there enough crappy stuff in the world without making movies about the worst of it this movie is really victimy too much like oh look poor little me my recommendation is to throw this straight from the wrapping to the waste disposal unit because its a wasted effort it might make you cry but it wo not hand you a hankie think of all the money they poured into it and wasted kinda like taking grade a maple syrup and pouring it all over your kitchen floor wasteful stickey certainly not smart go outside and hug a tree you will feel good but do not watch this movie if you want to feel good coz you wo not cannot depressing nonsense and hilary swank is way too butch and unattractive in this so there no hott chick content nor hott guy coz clint eastwood i think is way way way past having sex appeal lol,1
141,EN,1425373818,i must begin by confessing that i hate boxing so i will make this comment notwithstanding that well but is this movie really about boxing i do not think so i mean in my opinion boxing is here a mere pretext to tell a story about love friendship dedication will strength and fighting spirit for an aim the main character is a boxer by chance as she could be a soccer player a singer a dancer or a pianist and this is also the story of a false hard hearted guy who loses a daughter and meets another to whom he can give his fatherly love and get it returned this movie is made with a shall we say atrocious realism both visual and psychological and the acting performers do their best to express it the outcome though caused by a fortuitous or not fact inserts itself totally in the atmosphere created by the two main characters or three if we consider that the old ex boxer is also a catalyst of the whole process of events playing a fundamental part in the consciousness of the other two and acting somehow like their counterpoint i think we are perhaps in presence of one of the best #### movies if not the best one ,7
142,EN,-870616449,one of the most entertaining blockbusters of all time the avengers may not have the perfection of the holy grail of comic book adaptations i e the dark knight trilogy or logan but its significant emphasis on perfect balance of humour action throughout its runtime makes up for a highly rewarding experience that is far greater than what most films of its genre ever manage to come close to six marvel superheroes in one movie same save the world bullshit that we have seen been disappointed with countless number of times and yet the avengers works in an unexpected but very effective manner and is bigger better far more amusing plus enjoyable than all the previous films of the marvel cinematic universe combined and succeeds in surpassing all hype expectations with surprising but stunning ease as for the plot summary when the tesseract suddenly activates at the s h i e l d research facility and opens up a portal allowing loki brother of thor to reach the earth begin his mission of enslaving the whole planet nick fury director of s h i e l d reactivates the avengers initiative thus bringing natasha romanoff dr bruce banner tony stark steve rogers together who are later joined by thor clint barton to stop loki from succeeding with his plan the direction is extremely good as joss whedon has crafted an impressive piece of eye popping action extravaganza and to make sure that the film is not overloaded tiring filled it up with loads of humour the screenplay is witty plus the comic timing is brilliantly executed cinematography editing is carried out amazingly well and the original score by alan silvestri is a major plus as it strikes the right chord from start to finish thus enriching the whole experience coming to the performances it robert downey jr who delivers the strongest performance amongst all as tony stark iron man and thanks to the amazing wit charisma charm this amazing actor always brings to the screen with finesse it almost impossible to not like him yet the one who manages to steal the show in the end is none other than mark ruffalo terrific rendition of the hulk for he was absolutely merciless unstoppable and even tom hiddleston as loki manage to impress with his chilling performance on an overall scale the avengers is an ambitious adventure for the masses containing all the right ingredients of a genuine blockbuster material and the best thing about it is that nothing gets overdone as every element is present in its right dose be it action humour drama etc an astonishingly great initiative that will satisfy the majority of its viewers with its wildly entertaining fun filled roller coaster ride this is the perfect popcorn entertainer for all ages ,9
143,EN,-870616449,first of all the cast is that not alone to get you to the theater in the next ## minutes to see it if it not then how about all the records it has broken still not enough how about one amazing thrill ride of a movie with lots of action and comedy as well as a great storyline to go with it the avengers seriously has it all the characters all jump back into action except this time they are assembling their powers to form a team that cannot be beat the movie takes a little time to refresh you on any character development you may have forgotten and then it jumps right into the team building experience it takes a while for these superheros to learn how to use their powers together to help one another but once they learn how they are a force to be reckoned with once the action scenes start it does not slow down and you have yourself a good hour or more of solid action of buildings blowing up the hulk smashing everything and so much more calling a movie the best movie ever is almost used too much that the saying loses credibility but trust me on this the avengers seriously is the best movie yet that is until dark knight rises comes out then it may have some competition for that title check out our other reviews at http www reeltimereview com,9
144,EN,-870616449,the avengers is a great film and one of my favorites films of #### so far the acting was just amazing by all the actors involved in the film the best performances in the film were robert downey jr as iron man who played his character perfectly and mark ruffalo as hulk the director of the film was joss whedon who directed the film with a great passion to make a great avengers film which he did the basic plot was iron man hulk thor and captain america team up to try to stop loki from overtaking earth the actors in the film were robert downey jr chris evans mark ruffalo chris hemsworth samuel jackson scarlet johannson and jeremy renner overall the film was a major success and i cannot wait for the sequel ,10
145,EN,-870616449,i did not think this movie would live up to the expectations that surrounded it but luckily it did whoever has not seen this movie yet what the heck are you waiting for this is a great movie for comic book fans kids and anyone who loves some good ol action i really did not think this movie would have e been as good as it was without iron man hulk iron man # thor and captain america so i loved everything about this movie acting action plot special effects the only problem i personally had was just that hulk was not in it as much as i wanted but when he was there it was just epic also that the hulk really reminded me of a a gorilla at the end of the movie which i found just funny but other than that i can ignore the fact that odin just sent thor to earth the chintari just dying after the mother ship blew up and the excessive comedic relief i found it quite strange that the world was in danger of being taken over and all the characters took it so lightly and making jokes but still this movie was just awesome ## ## best movie this year ,10
146,EN,-870616449,this was the movie i have been an avenger ever since i was ## and was reading my first comic although i was a marvel fan well before that so i have been waiting for this movie for a good ## years avengers assemble is near enough the perfect movie and marvel have finally done the unthinkable and ousted the dark knight as greatest comic book movie and actually greatest movie of all time joss whedon as director put tingles down my spine as i am a major buffy and angel fan in addition to him writing the greatest x men story of all time astonishing x men i knew we was in excellent hands if there are # minor criticms of this movie it would be these # maria hill by cobie smulders im a major fan of himym and her character robin schebatsky and miss smulders is a major crush of mine however they made maria hill into your carbon copy standard issue agent if this was going to be the way no need for her to be so heavily featured in the advertising # the battle cry is not actually screamed out in the movie despite these # oversights it simply is the greatest movie of all time ## ##,10
147,EN,-870616449,like everyone else who was anticipating this movie i had heard the massive hype and built up my expectations to the point where let down was all but inevitable and so i went to the midnight first showing hoping for something good but half ready for a bit of disappointment things did not quite go like that to put it simply the avengers is a triumph of a comic book superhero film among fans it will no doubt rank as one of the best marvel based movies to date if not the best it a downright great action film right alongside any blockbuster and a fairly solid adventure film let start with the characters acting direction the team here is composed of seven heroes many of which have their own proper films and each of which is played by a very talented actor while this might seem to bode well at first glance it cannot be understated how hard it is to balance such strong personalities both the characters and the actors themselves how do you make one movie that basically wants to tell seven stories and where each of those stories basically demands to be center stage it not easy at all you have to fit a lot of pieces correctly and avengers is something which could easily have fallen flat if one of those pieces was off but joss whedon and cast did a commendable job of balancing all the characters needs together bringing each one fully to life while still allowing the team story to take center stage no one here gets left out everyone has their time in the sun and yet collectively it all fits together to make the movie more than just an ensemble of heroes but the story of an actual team in particular we see very good believable dynamics portrayed with how everyone is assembled then has to adjust to working in a group setting and ultimately become more effective within the avengers then they would be on their own in particular portrayals by robert downey chris evans mark ruffalo all shine in molding the team together iron man is used to going solo the hulk has never been able to be a team player and captain america has a hard time dealing with people who do not really want to follow a group that said it really was all bright spots in the cast and characterization let alone there is never once where the individual portrayal of the actual heroes comes into question they are all spot on the visuals and effects are of course as good as one would expect top notch all around as good as blockbusters get these days one thing that i did not expect is how funny this movie was there were so many good witty bits here and there i think people were laughing throughout the whole film some moments were outright hilarious which is another thing about this movie it was fun period if you can leave the film critic at home for a moment this movie is escapism at its best it a pure ride of action adventure and fun wrapped up in delicious effects the last half of the movie flows so smoothly it all over before you even know it some will want to compare this to the dark knight and basically they will criticize it because it not would ramatic enough but not every film is a drama not even necessarily every good film is a drama the avengers is not the godfather or dark knight and it was never meant to be but if you can live with that then it a fantastic action adventure movie right alongside such greats as indiana jones aliens and die hard among fans it is sure to become a classic and again it just wonderful escapism which aside from pixar animated films we do not usually get enough of these days everyone wants to be so serious it a family film too since there not much objectionable here overall very highly recommended ,10
148,EN,-870616449,i do not usually comment on a film for which i am completely neutral but this film deserves a neutral comment as it such a waste of time and money it exhibits the typical american obsession with violence and little or no character development after fast forwarding through all the crash bang wallop scenes and still keeping track of the plot i still did not care what happened to anyone including the planet scarlet johansson is completely miscast as the black widow she should be tall and willowy mark ruffalo is perfectly cast as the hulk as it suits his style of acting which is usually dumb i really am a fan of joss whedon and own the entire buffy collection but i counted two maybe three snappy lines of dialogue in this very disappointing i was going to give it # out of ## but decided it deserved # towards the end barely just too corny for words and silly in the extreme ,6
149,EN,-1981908864,i did not see such a good movie for a long time great story great acting great music i like the fact that it based on a true story if i am not wrong i love the little girl role and the way she performed it i believe it would not have been the same without her or with someone else perfoming that role to be specific and denzel was great with his sad bear eyes and i am looking for a soundtrack cause i really like una palabra and mas there are some parts i did not like like the breaking fingers scene or the fast exchanging scenes it predictable to some point but are not almost all movies lately but all in all i believe this was a movie with a brilliant idea and great realization ,7
150,EN,-1478459767,if this really is based on a true story i can only say that is completely awesome so this is an adventure story with action and how to survive then doing it in one place makes it so much more cool my favourite character was aron raiston because he like the main character and he the one that has to deal with his arm stuck under the rock which is pretty awesome and there something about the rock special effects that i want to say with it looking like it squashing franco arm but it really is not even though it looks so life like and sore is pretty impressive now to tell the truth i have only seen this two times but i can really see how so much people enjoyed it but i think i like it the most because it is very entertaining and i can see how much they tried to teach people about how to survive and be safe ,7
151,EN,978850958,one of the best and most stylish martial arts films of all time the choreography and wire work that was so impressive back in #### is still just as awesome today i have watched my fair share of martial arts flicks both old and new and none of them convey the art part of martial arts as effectively as crouching tiger hidden dragon the action scenes are so graceful and mesmerizing that they almost seem like ballet every fight scene is a visual feast with people flying floating leaping and running straight up walls and each scene manages to be more impressive than the last it poetry in motion and pleasantly there a nice story to serve as a background to the action it nothing you have not seen before a rebellious young woman forbidden love revenge etc it all simple and well presented all in all there not another modern martial arts film that i would recommend over crouching tiger it chooses to be elegant and restrained instead of gory and brutal and it a better movie for it ,8
152,EN,978850958,i grew up watching wuxia chinese martial arts films and my favourite shows were the once upon a time in china series starring jet li and a couple of other well loved hongkong wuxia serials perhaps they may not be the best but cthd was nowhere near their standard from the start the strangely accented mandarin of li mu bai shu lian and dark cloud jarred the entire feeling and mood of the movie no offense to chow yun fatt and michelle yeoh zhang ziyi came close but only when master tie spoke did one get the feeling that this was a chinese film next was the simply rendered dialogue which one can hear on the streets today it was simply unbearable there was none of the formal speech of those times just watch any jin yong series and you will get an idea all those witty conversations using idioms and verses are really cool the movie was anything but traditional we hardly see jen parents enough to feel the oppressiveness that she felt the only paternal presence that could be felt was in the form of master tie in fact it seemed to be more of a teenage angst type of movie like the o c or friends where the youth just did whatever they wanted the parents etc seemed to be placed there only as an dummy obstacle being filled with a lot of teenage angst from miss jen it is rather mind boggling as to what she is really angry about her wedding fair enough but that does not warrant picking a fight with the pugilists in sight running off to shu lian to cry after that and then suddenly breaking off all ties with her when she was the one who initiated the friendship first she may be a strong headed person but also most certainly insincere and a bit psychotic i might add furthermore there is very little character development here shu lian confided in jen but still one knows nothing about how shu lian and li mu bai actually grew closer together and who they really are to appreciate the close bond between them and oh yes the plot what plot really a princess falling in love and eloping with a bohemian in the desert sounds really exotic i guess but the bohemian was not even suave enough to sweep one off one feet plus his mandarin sounded terrible perhaps it was just to show off the fighting skills which admittedly were awesome but the lack of tension during these scenes made one feel like it was a match between two robots and do not get me started on jade fox bleah i started off watching in a happy mood and one hour after it ended i am still in a bad mood see the dark clouds over my head the only good things in the movie are chow yun fatt and the calligraphy scene but chow # d role does him little justice watch jin yong shows instead the fighting is better the plot and characters a hundred times more interesting ,10
153,EN,383108239, i am sure realism is exactly what spielberg was trying to achieve with a fictional sci fi movie that the poorest excuse i have ever heard for disliking a movie and i understand opinions are opinions but i am quite sure spielberg knows more about great cinema than the ignorant people on here anyway moving on of course the story is sentimental and i guess people could call it cheesy but thats why it sticks with so many people it brought them to a place they never felt before the first time they saw it personally i still love this movie because of the emotional aspect i do not think i would like this movie nearly as much if not for the cast dee wallace and peter coyote are amazing robert macnaughton is completely underrated he perfect as elliott brother mike and as elliott henry thomas is the heart and soul of this movie he really cute without being totally annoying unlike drew barrymore who only purpose there it seemed was just to be cute and captures the character of elliott perfectly i cannot even imagine anyone else playing him he was just perfect i still start to tear up whenever he does i really do not know what else to talk about people seem to either love or hate this movie if you have not seen it yet do not go by what people say on here not even me see it for yourself and decide ,9
154,EN,383108239,as a young kid in the early ####s i could not get enough indiana jones i am fortunate that my parents let me watch jaws and i loved it seeing close encounters of the third kind at a friend house left lasting images and ideas in my mind but e t did nothing for me despite the fact that it was in theory spielberg most child oriented blockbuster when i saw it for the first and until now only time i was the same demographic as the child star but the experience was frankly boring i remember feeling if not putting into words that the movie with the boy and the inarticulate yoda like puppet was slow and cold it was far less engaging to me than the other spielberg titles to which i had been exposed i do not remember if i knew that they were products of the same director but the art of movies which ebert compared to a machine that generates empathy a tool for looking at the world through different eyes was working on me i was already accustomed to relating to adults on screen instead of just kids whatever holes e t might have filled for me as a nascent movie buff were already occupied by more grown up and therefore more exciting material if i was in the mood for pure fun with a sci fi flavor the star wars vhs tapes with their more attention grabbing special effects and attention keeping pace were right there it was no contest revisiting e t now i do not see much cause to regret my early rejection of it in fact it probably worse now because it hard to find an original cut i had to watch the ill advised digital remaster in which certain camera positions no longer make sense and the actors are often looking just behind e t instead of at him as they presumably did when he was a puppet instead of pixels even ignoring the awkwardness of the digital content which really does great damage to the feel and persona of the title character there little in e t that feels real or fresh the first part of the film takes place mainly in the home of the boy elliott the house always seems dim on the inside lit by late afternoon sun even when it midday outside elliott makes an emotional connection with the alien almost too easily aided by an unexplained psychic connection between the two and he causes some chaos with frogs in a heavy handed scene that spielberg seems determined to cram with ideas never to be unpacked elliott and his older brother are bland generic kids and they gang up on their young sister who is a breath of fresh air and a splash of color around the edges of the increasingly disturbing main story it not just that drew barrymore is cute in the role she also a natural actor stealing scenes from all her older costars plus the alien having a real live barrymore on their hands you would think the filmmakers would have rethought the whole thing and cast her as e t main companion it her after all who teaches e t his most important vocabulary words and figures out what he wants to do phone home the final act takes an unsatisfying route to this conclusion with a messily edited illogical home invasion by astronauts that segues into a dark riff on the massive government operation from close encounters it a nightmarish cycle of silly and sad and shrill right up to the final scene but there are two particular moments that do work these are the iconic bicycle flights one eclipsing the moon and the other the sun and they are made magical and memorable with the help of john williams accompanying score i might appreciate these moments more now than i did as a kid having seen them depicted in spielberg production logo over the years and developed a fondness for the idea of them but all things considered i still think i made the right decision years ago to watch star wars a fifteenth time instead of e t a second ,2
155,EN,-1343058039,warning spoilers ahead the opening scene accurately portrays the darkness that enshrouds the secretive and veiled identity of the character that has been discovered in mysterious circumstances floating in the sea having been left for dead cue the haunting overture he would have been invisible in the water if it were not for the flashing distress light on his wet suit watch out for scenes in the film where the camera pans across making it seem as though the character just disappears you will understand the importance of the ability of this character being invisible as the plot unravels although passing fishermen come to his aid when he regains consciousness the character finds he still in the dark regarding his sense of self he has retrograde amnesia and is frustrated trying to find the trigger he needs to tap into the temporarily unavailable memory file that stores his true identity a series of turbulent events occur that provide invaluable pieces of the jigsaw but it becomes increasingly evident that the puzzle is far more complex and intricately interwoven than first thought as he gets closer to finding out more about his assumed identity jason bourne it appears as if the character is as cold and calculating as the antagonists he up against but we later find out that battling with his conscience was the deep seated root of his problems having weathered the tempestuous storm locked horn battles with biro pens at the ready perfectly illustrating that the pen is mightier than the sword and a nail biting car chase bourne finally gets to step out of the shadows and into the welcoming reassuring sunlight signalling an end to the dark and dreary tunnel he had to travel in an attempt to discover exactly who he was honestly he does travel in a darkened tunnel not just me being overzealous with the clich and on a train that from the front uncannily resembles k# for those of you who do not know who or more specifically what k# is then do not worry i am just showing my age in my opinion this is a really cool film that i would wholeheartedly recommend to watch it action packed in a realistic way and thankfully never stoops as low as the murky depths of being ott and also manages to add spice with a hint of romance simmering away gently in the background personally i like the alternative way of travelling downstairs without actually using the stairs or sliding down the banisters but as always folks do not try it at home or else your neighbours will be really cheesed and with no tomato sauce effects real blood is just too messy trust me also it not just jason bourne who has the potential to disappear here in the uk that red bag would have done a disappearing act well before jason got the chance to reach the bottom of the building and the likelihood of the cctv being switched on would be negligible ok so hands up is that the cynicism police i see before me a new slant on the film with bourne chasing after the thief who for obvious reasons could not be called amy with the possibility of ending up in a desert valley bordering e california and w nevada where bourne finally meets up with his long lost buddy called gerry alacasey could for all intents and purposes be aptly titled run the fcuk jason run ok perhaps not ,9

157,EN,-484170602,ok i have been waning to start writing reviews for movies books tv shows and music for quite some time now never a better time to begin than with the latest version of the hunger games since i never read the second book i did read the first however since i felt they did such a great job at adapting the book to the movie i did not feel the need to read the second book i cannot judge the adaptation from book to movie therefore my review is based solely on the theatrical version story very well done indeed while a tad predictable the story is done well enough to keep you involved until the end the build up is very dramatic and it has some very good twists that will leave your jaw on the ground presentation the film looks beautiful it is very similar to the first movie in many aspects which is a good thing considering the first movie was so good to begin with and nothing is left out in this one either my only grip is that the battle scenes in this one were weaker than the first movie again i did not read the book this time but i remember from reading the first book i felt like the battle scenes in that one were way dumbed down and i felt the scenes in this one were even weaker than the first i understand they are placating to a pg ## audience which is why the battles are not very gory and detailed but the whole games scenes in this movie just seemed very rushed to me that would be one of my major gripes but again i never read the book so i do not know if that was intentional or not nevertheless the film looked amazing and seemed like they were able to switch between drab and vibrant environments so seamlessly the special effects were very well done quite impressive indeed overall i would say this movie did a great job of setting up the finale a lot of this movie seemed to mirror the first one and if you were a fan of the first movie you will love this one too but i do not think they will be able to go the same route in the finale i feel it will be much different in style but there was much to love about part ii from the engaging story strong acting special effects etc it had that very epic feel to it with an amazing ending which just left you salivating for the finale they have done a very good job with this series and you could tell that they did not want to change much from the previous installment # # out of # ,8

160,EN,1990126744,i really wanted to like pleasantville the previews looked spectacular i was quite happy with the acting and visual effects i loved the score by randy newman i liked all of the characters and the actors portraying them my major problem with the film was with the disjointed script i do not believe it was focused well and i do not believe it was written with a clear vision of what it wanted to convey there were many holes i felt no emotion and only mildly chuckled two or three times i wanted something to make me feel something essentially to bring color into my life for the first hour i was under the impression that it was sex which gave the characters their color then i thought maybe it was passion but by the end of the film i was still unsure i liked the references to art and literature and music giving life its color and while i am certainly no prude i think sex was overemphasized and i was especially disappointed with the idea that mom bathtub masturbation scene was what brought color to her life oh how i wish that was all it took to achieve color in one life in that respect i believe the film stumbled and failed in getting at its intended point that our realization of our own unique place within the universe is what ultimately illuminates us simply experiencing rage passion or orgasm alone wo not get it ,10
161,EN,871649949,this edition of pride and prejudice is the truest adaptation i have seen of jane austen famous novel i was surprised that the movie was made in the reasonably recent wake of the very popular bbc tv mini series with colin firth darcy but i am glad it was the film like the series had awe inspiring landscapes and stately home settings my favourite was a scene in the peak district with keira knightley just standing on some rocks on a hill the difference between this version of pride and prejudice and the others was the faultless acting keira captured elizabeth bennett persona as i had read her highly intelligent opinionated and with a strong sense of playful mischief matthew macfadyen had darcy arrogance but also a credible sense of vulnerability which made one believe that elizabeth could have fallen for him i was left wondering in other versions how on earth elizabeth could have any feelings beyond gratitude for darcy because he still remained very contained brenda blethyn was perfect as the mother a role very easy to overact as mrs bennett character is so crass another aspect i liked about this film is that it truly reflected the family in their status of genteel poverty they have a lovely home but it is rather the worse for wear one thing i had to chuckle at though was the state of the farm i cannot believe that anyone would let their yard get into such a scruffy state no matter how little money they had a surprisingly good film my husband enjoyed it very much also ergo not your standard period drama for the girls # ##,9
162,EN,871649949,i am not someone who gets teary eyed about the classics or period dramas so it was with due hesitation that i started to watch this movie in fact i only attempted it because it was referenced in the uk comedy series red dwarf initially all of misgivings seemed justified and whilst i found the characters to be larger than life the painful stereotypes seemed rather unsubtle but then as the plot started to twist and things that had seemed black and white became less clearcut i found myself drawn into a world where people are not expected to socialise far less marry outside their class i was particularly impressed by the gradual metamorphosis of mr darcy who managed to move from villain to hero without ever perceptibly altering his persona the sheer charm of keira knightley is impossible not to love but for my favourite character had to be donald sutherland who despite spending scant minutes on screen managed to add a strength of presence that brought the film to a wonderful conclusion i would agree with the comments that have been made about the quality of the filming and costumes and i particularly loved the misty english morning scene near the end which shows england as i love it quiet and beautiful a charming and excellent acted piece that stands out amid a sea of lightweight populist movies greatly recommended ,9
163,EN,216660589,does not have as much substance compared to fellowship of the ring but still a pretty solid movie but lord of the rings has # separate novels that make up the trilogy and three separate movies while the hobbit is just one book so peter jackson probably tried to fit every detail of the book into this movie and other written stuff by j r r tolkien the movie starts off slow in fact it takes quite a while before the journey takes off but when it does kick off it becomes a entertaining adventure but the build up is still good as well it does a good enough job to make the viewers satisfied but crave more which is most definitely a positive when planning for a sequel as well it more action packed compared to fellowship of the ring though and some action scenes seems far fetched how things play out but it still humorous at times the cinematography is just crystal clear as well and adds to the fantasy style some complain about the faster frame rate but i personally liked it and looks more likes those fantasy drawings gandalf is just super cool in this movie in fact he is one of the coolest old guy in a movie ever you know the part where the crew tries to escape from moria while battling orcs goblins trolls and balrog and it was cool but the escape scene from inside the misty mountains when the dwarfs get taken captive and gandalf shows up this escape scene takes it to another level and is the highlight of this movie peter jackson also did a great job of picking the cast for this movie like he did for the lord of the rings trilogy there is also quite a lot of cgi compared to lord of the rings trilogy but since technology got more advanced it just top notch overall this lacks substance compared to fellowship of the ring and a bit less intriguing and it also slow moving but it a movie most definitely worth checking out in #d # # ##,8
164,EN,216660589,i will try to make a concise overview of the movie without analyzing it deeply and technically first of all i am a great fan of hobbit and lotr series i read the books and saw the former movies in the movie theater probably more than three times each in my last watch i saw them all at once at one session which took my almost ##h straight from evening till morning with a horde of people inside a big theater in munich germany well that was ## years ago when i have read there will be the prequel to lotr i was quite excited since sir jackson will be sitting on the director chair once again and the same common players like gandalf by ian mckellen will be on the new movie as well in the beginning i thought it would be only one movie since hobbit itself is the shortest of all the four books later it revealed to be two parts and finally just recently turned out to be three movies i was a bit worried that hobbit series would not taste like the previous ones since the thinnest book will be segmented into three parts well after i saw the unexpected journey it left an unexpected positive impression on me and i hurried to the theater once again at the earliest possibility in fact just a few hours ago i saw it the second time and decided to write my ever first review in imdb to tell you the truth the movie is beyond any expectation congrats and thanks to peter jackson the taste is even better than previous ones in the new series which is like a prototype of the older series a new journey with a different purpose though there is a deep feeling of mourning and sadness you understand this better when you see it the second time the theme song of the movie misty mountains which became also the general score of the entire movie is also unexpectedly in harmony with the score of the lotr series with a new taste though this is a wonderful job congrats to howard shore for the awesome score that i could not keep my eyes from the tear drops and my mouth from murmuring of the words of the song the mourning in the movie probably comes from the state of dwarfs that basically they are homeless and the new trilogy is about to claim their home back and of course the introduction for the one ring of the rings of no doubt revealing of colleagues of gandalf like radagast as well as new creatures make the movie unique and different than former ones overall it was an unexpected same experience and i recommend to everybody newcomers as well as definitely to older fans by the way for sure that i will see it the third time on the big screen before it gone one last thing i may not aware of it but there has to be definitely a story for the one stone the arkenstone even mr jackson would picture a new world with different races which took place long before than hobbits who used the arkenstone for different purposes anyway i thought it would make a perfect spin off to the movie or a prequel to the hobbit ,10
165,EN,802756256,if just something different the world of superheroes has been exploited in recent years and deadpool leaves the pattern it was worth the wait to ryan reynolds good action much sarcasm and comedy violence and blood at times it seems a parody but it happens there are things that perhaps might be improved but by way of rights did not like the rest of the x men another thing that strikes me is that if deadpool is able to regenerate a hand because he is not regenerate or healthy skin i still recommend her remember it for adults ,9
166,EN,802756256,first off i knew very little about deadpool before going into this movie part because i am not big into comics and also to avoid any spoilers as i was admittedly caught up in the hype i do not even like ryan reynolds most of the time but he on another level in this the serious parts he plays incredibly well pulling the audience on the team deadpool bleachers by the end of the film every joke hit with roaring laughter at the screening i attended and the fun was entirely infectious this is the kind of movie my generation wants to see terrifying yet hilarious crude but smart and oh so deliciously gory the fact that it sits with over # ## but at a ## currently on the professional critics scale shows how far from relevant these people opinions are bring on deadpool # raise a statue in his honor and let all enjoy life a little ,10

170,EN,691727019,why cannot more directors these days create horror movies like the shining there an easy answer to that modern day directors are not stanley kubrick kubrick proved once and for all with this movie that he is truly one of the greatest directors and auteurs of all time so the plot is fairly simple a man named jack torrance played brilliantly by jack nicholson and his family move into a large secluded hotel to watch over it for the off season the kicker is that the previous caretaker of the hotel savagely murdered his wife and two girls what follows can most readily be summed by the title of the movie but you have to watch it to see what i mean this is the first movie in a very long time to strike me as scary it some seriously messed up stuff but in a good way one of the things that adds to the scare factor is the amazing music music has been a major part of kubrick movies #### a space oddysey and a clockwork orange just to name a couple and he definitely does not disappoint with this one the score completely sets the tone and this film would not be the same without it finally i must comment on nicholson legendary performance jack is terrifyingly convincing as a crazy killer in fact just his stare steals a few scenes of this movie this is top notch acting that must be seen to believe there will never be a horror movie that quite matches this one r i p stanley ,10
171,EN,1709555887,where to start of with this film first of all it was amazing and sorry dc fan boys but marvel have won this time not all will agree but i would say this is marvel best film yet throughout the film you are treated to a wide range of exiting action scenes a plot that is as good as any oscar winning film and acting that could not get any better if it tried the russo brothers joe and anthony have created a marvel pun intended of a superhero film that any marvel fan or any film buff would be proud of the all star cast really says it all it certainly proves that they are all still at the top of their careers and they do not look like they will be coming down for a while yet every actor put in as much work into this film as each other the acting in this film is something that any movie watcher would enjoy and they would find themselves wondering if they are actually there themselves not one part of this glorious work of a film will leave you bored or wanting more the plot unlike most superhero films actually gets better as it goes on one of the films directors joe russo described this film as a psychological thriller and that i can agree with a film that will make you look behind you after going to see it civil war is a roller coasts of emotions and intensities and with surprises that lets be honest no one expected especially that while agent ## debacle anyway back to the review this film will make you laugh with the perfect amount of humour from each character the balance out the politics of this film you will not go home disappointed with well choreographed fighting scenes and intense level of action even michael bay would be impressed but not to much to ruin the whole aspect of the film it not just about a fight between two friends it about what is wrong and what is right although in my eyes captain america is right each character gets plenty of screen time contrary to popular belief and you will be happy that you get the see each character in a way you have not seen them before every character has their own little plot in a much bigger story and they all come to an end by the end of the film the only problem i have is that it was not longer but what marvel and their amazing directors have to work on now is the villain although this film is amazing without one a villain always adds to the tension of a film do not get me wrong he was acted brilliantly but marvel just cannot seem to get villains right but i can forgive them and so can everyone because the film was so spectacular this film has changed marvel forever in a good way from a kid friendly film to a kind of gritty suspenseful movie that has elements of terror and realism in it well for a superhero film that is to finish this off i would like to say that they did not let us down with the end credits both so stay until the very end gave us teasers for two new films that got girls and middle aged men alike screaming with excitement after they had finished to summarise this film is the perfect start the phase # marvel films and a great influence on many films to come well done captain i salute you ## ## ##th april ####,10

174,EN,1474345136,many psychological thrillers rely on twists to deliver their climactic pay off but director christopher nolan brain wringing psycho noir memento is not just a movie with a twist it is a twist essentially memento is a straightforward revenge flick with the central protagonist out to track down the man who raped and murdered his wife but this standard plot comes with an ingenious twist as we soon find out that our befuddled hero is on a voyage of self discovery like no other matters are complicated by the fact that the person investigating the killing leonard shelby an outstanding guy pearce eliciting sympathy and hinting at the rage behind his obsession while also leavening the character with moments of humor has the memory of a goldfish a rare form of amnesia leaving him with no short term memory forced to record everything with copious notes polaroid photographs and even tattoos leonard obsession leads him into a world where no one can be trusted this coupled with christopher nolan audacious conceit that necessitates the plot to run backwards makes memento a dazzling highly original anti thriller thus we begin with the climactic murder then regress through the events that led up to it to wind up well at the beginning memento is a mesmerizing mind bender a diabolical and absorbing experience that requires a lot of concentration but the stunning final scene is ample reward christopher nolan builds a mousetrap of a neo noir using the tricky gimmick of a complex purposefully disorienting narrative that puts us in the scrambled mind of its protagonist as the strangely captivating screenplay unfolds in scenes of reverse order he gives us a taste of leonard frustrating existence events unfolding for the audience in the same way they unfold for pearce character we are thrown out of time and robbed of the comfort of a chrono logical unspooling of information nolan cranks up the suspense keeps the story sharp and pacey and is not afraid to layer in a little ultra black humor the impact is insidious chances are your brain will be replaying this fiendish puzzle of a film for months to come christopher nolan cinematic gaze into an abyss of madness obsession identity and wrath remains a compelling puzzle long after its revelations have rolled out of all the ironies which fill the film the most complementary may be that this is film which will not soon be forgotten ,10
175,EN,1474345136,since i have started watching and reviewing movies i was searching for innovation and fantastically what then happened it proved actually that my theory about british directors have stile been wrong that was when i saw memento at first i found it unusual that the film begins extremely violent do even the most controversial films ever made like cannibal holocaust or what is more possible that this film is a copy of that movie pulp fiction do not begin by killing people by showing how they die its true that a shock for the audience and that they will stay to see the movie but the next move was so unprofessional like he did never get a video camera in his hands he broke the main rule of every filmmaker that ever broke a rule he tortured the audience by showing too many flashbacks the rule of every film is not to do a same thing more then # times or # times but not at once even if you look at pulp fiction it got not less then # yeah seven my friends seven memento got ## jumps a man a normal human looses every wish to see a thing if you have repeated something more then ## times i am somehow surprised that it became a success i have nothing against the actors because nolan chooses quite well actors what i am really mad are the characters in every nolan movie the characters are mean evil stupid i mean you do not have to think in nolan movies they tell you anything at the end so you have to just watch the end cause anything else it for throwing away the horrible music poor characters and no style directing only some trademarks but nothing else but let go back to memento you may have notice that the characters are changing but from good up to evil this lends realism that for sure but it does not automatically made a great feature some of you would probably say that a man gets rotten because the society wont help him with his problem but that not the case in memento leo the guy who actually killed the only person who was ever kind to him and understood his problem teddy what makes leonard a guy who does not want any help from anyone which turns his character not into a anti hero but more a antagonist he has no purpose he does not want any help he loves nobody a villain finally some of you might think that i am only writhing bad reviews all the time but true that i love much worse movies and writhe reviews that show how charming films are i even see something positive in michael bays films but this film does not have a place at imdb top ### i will give this film a rating # # out ha ## # cause i still think that the idea to have a whole film going backwards nice as well the actors are pretty good and its not easy to forget such a film but its nothing special or innovative its mean evil not well directed and overrated,4

180,EN,288564766,top bananas part of the concept of this heist thriller is that there very little confrontation much of the appeal of the film is the drama sustained as satellite subplots these burgeoning vignettes are stylishly executed the viewer attention veers between the central heist the characters and their own agendas as they are meticulously revealed there is good acting from a large ensemble cast most of the time the principals play down their lead status being that the film is coming out of leftfield of the genre conversely the minor parts have greater weight than scripted extras and play their roles well it not going to change your life or win significant awards but its a thoroughly satisfying matin e # ##,8

187,EN,1239968958,watching david lynch mulholland drive filled me with such wonder and awe so i decided to watch his #### classic dark mystery blue velvet and it took me back to the same world a place where the images are shocking and where mysteries occur the two movies almost contain the same elements two curious heroes weird villains vibrant images and mind blowing mysteries lynch eccentric direction is evident he gently plays with the audience minds providing us with sometimes unexplainable stories while we unexplainably cannot stop watching in the opening scenes in blue velvet we see sights of a small seemingly normal city called lumberton we see various people waving and enjoying their quiet little day a man is quietly watering his garden when he suddenly collapses in the grass with his hose still at hand then the camera slowly zooms towards him until we see ants deep in the ground that we could not normally see this is a metaphor for the evil that lurks behind the quiet town a strange and dangerous world that will unfold as the movie progresses the hero of the movie is a college student named jeffrey beaumont kyle maclachlan who goes back to his hometown to visit his sick father while taking a stroll he discovers a severed human ear in a grass field which he immediately gave to the cops curious and hungry for information he and a police detective daughter named sandy laura dern conduct their own investigation which led them to a mysterious singer named dorothy vallens isabella rossellini showing his adventurous side jeffrey convinces sandy to help him enter dorothy apartment and look for clues when he finally got into the apartment he found out more than he ever needed he discovered that dorothy husband and son are taken hostage and in order to save them dorothy needs to do sick sexual favors to frank booth dennis hopper one of the most psychotic and terrifying villains i have ever seen hopper plays the character with such rage and temper he vividly creates an inhumane person in the most frightening and disturbing way possible hopper amazing performance carries this movie but it also hinders it in a way his performance is so dark and disturbing and it just does not match the overall tone of the other scenes and the ending it seems like that lynch wants his audience to leave the movie with a smile but it hard to smile since we just seen troubling and horrible images the tone of the movie oscillates instead of maintaining which would have better fitted this kind of movie i also had problems with isabella rossellini performance i did not feel an intellectual communication with the character because she is hard to analyze and to figure out her true feelings and personality in one scene she appears suffering from molestations from frank but in another scene she asks jeffrey to hit her while making love as if she enjoys getting hurt she shows signs of love for her kidnapped child but refuses to take action and get help from the authorities but despite these drawbacks i was still gripped by the movie and for that reason i am recommending it i enjoyed hopper performance and i was absorbed by the surreal imagery in the underground scenes there are some genuinely terrifying scenes complemented by menacing dialogue and bizarre yet ideal acting lynch writing though not stellar is just good enough to hold the audiences attention while the great images are shown blue velvet is a very interesting movie a neo noir mystery wrapped in an extraordinarily strange world grade b,5

210,EN,631676366,after watching this i was left with very mixed feelings and honestly did not have a clue what to do with it the story deals with an old school nun played by meryl streep who is principal of a parish school who without any real evidence accuses a priest whom she obviously does not like of sexual misconduct with a student essentially that the story in that sense it simple and straightforward my first reaction was a sense of relief that in an age when about the only thing we hear about catholic priests is allegations of sexual misconduct we were essentially being shown a movie about the priest as a victim except that in this case he being victimized by a nun it seems again to be a case somewhat subtler than some of the church and or religion being used as a whipping boy the message seems to be that the church religion religious people cannot be portrayed in a good light frankly i believed father flynn philip seymour hoffman while he clearly had some personal demon that tormented him i never believed that he abused the boy but this movie still comes across as a slam because of the horrible behaviour of sister aloysius who demonstrates ultimately that she will go to any lengths honest or not to destroy this man that the abuse issue in the catholic church is caused by the very structure of the catholic church is demonstrated the extremely hierarchical and secretive nature of the church tends as we have seen to insulate the accused behind a protective veil at times that pointed out here as flynn points out to aloysius that she should be following proper channels in making her accusations insisting on the use of proper procedures does not mean a priest is guilty of course it the system but the very system adds to suspicion and gossip the damage that can be done by unfounded gossip is clearly illustrated by flynn with the pillow story i found the reaction of the boy mother when aloysius shared her suspicions with her troubling to say the least and the end of the movie was to me a bit empty aloysius confesses her doubts to sister james amy adams doubts about what has her belief in flynn guilt caused her to doubt her faith has the response of the church simply assigning flynn to another parish caused her to doubt the church or is she suddenly admitting doubt about flynn guilt and remorse about forcing him out of the parish doubt is valuable in a life of faith raising questions is what pushes us to grow and ultimately expand our faith but i still would have liked to have known exactly what her doubts were about there also food for thought here about how easy it is for people in certain professions teacher clergy doctor police etc to be falsely accused and have their reputations destroyed simply because someone decides that they do not like them i was not overwhelmed by the performances in this movie hoffman was good as flynn while i had trouble accepting streep in the role of aloysius amy adams with an air of innocence about her was believable as sister james concerned about the boy concerned about father flynn being treated unfairly concerned about the behaviour of aloysius but all the way through seeming confused as to what she should do about it the movie is not exciting but it does raise a lot of questions for that alone i give it a # ## ,8

212,EN,-1621537004,after winning oscars for forrest gump star tom hanks and director robert zemeckis teamed up for a #### epic called cast away a compelling and well made drama but for me a very difficult film to watch with minimal re watch appeal hanks plays chuck noland an executive with federal express whose life is changed forever when he is involved in a plane crash which he survives and ends up stranded on a deserted island for four years no episode of gilligan island here as we watch this man initially in denial about what has happened to him anticipating rescue in a few days but as time passes he can no longer deny what is happening to him and must learn how to survive while simultaneously trying to cling to his sanity evidenced in an actual relationship he develops with a volleyball which he names wilson and takes care of like a newborn baby this film is challenging because it goes places where other plane crash dramas have never gone for example there is a horrific moment when chuck actually discovers the body of the pilot of the plane and goes through his wallet i do not ever remember a film like this where the body of someone who did not survive was even mentioned let alone revealed the film also takes its time in having chuck accept his plight i like the way chuck keeps his clothes on initially because he really thinks he going to be found quickly but eventually he starts wearing less and less to the point where he is just in a loin cloth and his pants are now covering his head even common health issues come to the surface here when chuck develops a toothache and has no choice but to pull the tooth out himself a scene i literally cannot watch anymore director zemeckis employs a keen eye for detail and realism here this film contains what is probably the most frighteningly realistic plane crash i have ever seen in a movie the moments before the plane hits the panic in the pilots voices chuck iron fisted clutch of a picture of his fianc e helen hunt it all rang true and was just horrifying to watch and when chuck was literally underwater trying to fight his way out of the plane i was literally holding my own breath another zemeckis touch to ensure realism is that after the initial scenes up to the plane crash were filmed he shut down production of the film for a couple of months to give hanks time to lose ## pounds to make his desperate diving for fish in the ocean look more desperately authentic and to show that chuck was no longer eating regularly zemeckis also knows how to make his viewer squirm particularly in his depiction of chuck relationship with wilson the moment when wilson falls off the raft and chuck is unable to save him is heartbreaking and pathetic you feel for chuck while at the same time you cannot help but think uh it a volleyball one of my absolute favorite cinematic pictures occurs in this film as well the shot of chuck raft quietly floating in the ocean as a giant ship floats by right next to him this film is beautifully made and tells a very difficult story tom hanks received a richly deserved oscar nomination and helen hunt makes the most of her small role as his confused fianc e but this film is really hard to watch putting myself in chuck shoes was a very uncomfortable experience that i do not wish to duplicate it a superb movie and i am glad i saw it but i have no desire to ever see it again ,8

218,EN,-1286367522,sorry but i just hate it when the director intentionally includes something ridiculous to cause aggravation in the viewer this seems to be something that has been accepted as a reasonable tool to engage the viewer however i see it as cheap as when a comic over uses foul language since that seems to entertain the weak minded tom hanks plays the professional very well he is portrayed as not just good at his job but also very intelligent explain why after knowing he disabled at least temporarily the man he knows has been assigned to kill him and his son and also having met him knows he is a bit insane and fanatic about it he runs out of the room he knew he was temporarily helpless and had no reason to run at that point being a professional he would have ended him yet suddenly he becomes terrified during a situation he would have coolly handled if the director wanted this killer to be used in the final scene he had only to introduce police rushing into the area one of many other events to create the outcome he desired the only explanation is as i said in the opening purposely create the situation where the viewer is pushed to extreme irritation by the ignorance of the action that he did not finish him at that point and as i already said i see this as a very cheap and easy method to evoke emotion from the viewer rather than actually build a situation that is realistic ,9

233,EN,616860393,the historical aspects of gangs is quite interesting and extremely informative scorcese is outstanding in juxtaposing the politics of today with those of the past who would of known unless you were a thorough historian that lincoln administration was involved in the awful conscription of immigrants into this man army truly a bridge to the future however the story seems like some over wrought highly produced passion play or made for tv movie it truly lacks the genius of scorsese the ability to take gritty disgusting vile image of people and converting them into characters that we can sympathize with in context we all loved jimmy and tommy in goodfellas but can we say the same of the melodramatic amsterdam in taxi driver he takes an urban landscape of scum and depravity shows us a psychotic man and enables us to feel for this horrible beast he demonstrates some of his patented techniques in gangs such as the panning shot and the quick zoom the silent commentary of the immigrants registering as citizens enlisting in the conscript boarding the vessel for the war zone and the coffins leaving the ship is quite majestic that is truly vittorio de sica that is part of martin genius that tells a story with cameron diaz and henry thomas it feels like legends of the fall at times dicaprio is good and daniel day lewis is brilliant a bit over the top but brilliant my favorite brendan gleason is grossly under used and john c reilly is strong but half of a character what happened to him between being a bought cop and his days with the dead rabbits editing room floor i imagine i would recommend the film but would use caution do not be disappointed if you are true scorsese fan this is a different type of film ,7

235,EN,1513866478,a must see for all smokers and non smokers as well in the world great movie perfectly played by the actors they had me nailed to my chair for the full length of the film the rotten thing is though that it a true story ,9

237,EN,281810671,surely one of the best films of the #### or even perhaps of the last quarter of the ##th century everything about this movie from the complete character foil of amadeus compared to salieri the conflict within conflict storyline of the rise of genius versus the toil of mediocrity to the ultimate demise of # men one whose talent is consumed by the ravages of alcohol and guilt while the other soul is consumed by the power of envy it the very rare modern day film with all the trappings of today film debauchery language sex violence etc that could just as easily have been produced back in the golden age of hollywood pre #### f murray abraham portrayal of salieri is truly oscar award worthy what better way to teach history than to show it through the eyes of the third person in which every step of the title character role is seen with enough detail as to not confine the character within the facts of histories already known yes as within most hollywood rendering of history there are surely many facts that have been left to the director screenwriter interpretation but then again this is entertainment not education a must see ,10
238,EN,2015547123,although i do not consider lock stock to be as good as reservoir dogs i believe snatch is the brittish version of pulp fiction with different sense of humour and coolness there no samuel l jackson in snatch but there is a funny and excellent brad pitt there are not as many colours in snatch as in pulp fiction but there a lot more red blood all these comparisons can be easily made between these two movies but snatch will never match up to pulp fiction this new wave of gangster movies is born right out of their time and why does guy ritchie like to confuse the audience with a large numbered cast he did it in lock stock and he does it here again final though snatch with its character development and even story unleashing is the bigger cast and bigger budget version of lock stock two smoking barrels ,7
239,EN,-1044384524,i also had some issues against it seeing this last night on the movie channel and of course owning it and also owning the script i think it is a good film it could have been better as well after tony and manny quit their dish washing jobs and after being in the us for a few weeks they do not seem to be hard up for cash even before taking on their new found careers as drug dealers when they snort coke and lots of it they do not seem to get high or if they are they do not seem to change in any respect now if i were to stick my face in a bag of coke and inhale my eyes would be red my nose would be stuffed and my head would be focked but that is not the case with any of the actors who partake in the fine recreational medication of coca they just seem the same and that does not fare to be realistic at all they should have been wired yappy schizo psycho and neurotic but they were not also when frank lopez is about to be killed in his dealership he crawls on his knees and begs to tony offering to pay him ## ### ### not to be killed that was just absurd he whined like a baby the guy was a high roller and just caved in too fast it did not quite fit his character with all the attention that tony made in the bar and in the restaurant nobody said anything just not real it was good but as good as it was it could have been better however it had some awesome lines which will stand the test of time in cinematic history i would have loved to see tony montana after doing half a kilo of coke in one snort just sweating buckets his eyes red and puffy his lips ranting his body shaking his mind scattered and his character just ballistic and freaking he did not and that is where this film falls short ,6
240,EN,1555775733,let me first start off with the technical skills leonardo performance etc are remarkable to say the least imo this was just a multi million dollar epic revenge flick leo deserves an oscar for this considering what he must have endured however what we are expected to believe in surviving not just one but two bear attacks another issue was distancing me from the reality of the film there were far too many camera lens fogging up why they used such close lens was a big mistake when a bear gets right in front of the lens for it close up why would they think it a good idea for the image to fog up tom hardy still amazes me by his changing appearances in everything he does but what the hell accent was he trying to do for me this was equivalent to there will be blood which i found as boring as watching paint dry it also suffers with the same lack of musicality which is nonexistent in short there is no way any human could survive such torture as bored as i was it will grab picture and actor which is deserving ,8
241,EN,1555775733,there is almost nothing good to say about this film it was painful to watch slow no joy or any good feelings and just plain boring after a while i cannot understand why it got so many awards even the nature scenes which were beautiful were impossible to enjoy because of the feeling of dread hanging over every scene the last hour was predictable i dreaded what was to come holding out hope that it would not be a long drawn out ending to an exhausting film unfortunately the pain was drawn out like a bad dream that would not end it is worse than a waste of my money it ruined my evening and will make me feel awful for days avoid this film ,1
242,EN,1555775733,this is a hard movie to watch and while i enjoyed it it is not one i would jump at to watch again the cast and crew really earned the awards they won for this movie not only was it shot on location out in the woods in the harsh weather conditions without any artificial light you can see the effort and the suffering the actors in this movie had to go through for their art this is movie making at it best it is difficult to make it through the whole movie due to the long time it took to get from event to event and the sometimes really gross and disturbing images it was often times hard to keep my attention and other times it made me want to cover my eyes however i do appreciate that when a character gets injured they are not fixed in the next scene even though sometimes you want it to hurry up also as a history major i was impressed with the realistic and historical accuracy of life in the #### for both native americans and the white man this is beautifully shot beautifully produced and beautifully acted if you are willing to sit through a difficult movie with not a lot of dialogue and are interested in seeing the ugly side of the frontier along with it amazing beauty then you will most definitely like this movie even if you never watch it again this is well worth seeing at least once ,10
243,EN,1268995831,this true life based story is one that will become a classic it is very touching and adjusts our perception of how things are viewed those who have not heard the true story will be amazed by the twist that opens one mind john nash a natural mathematical genius goes to princeton for his degree while there he accepts a real assignment from the pentagon to decipher a cryptic communist message from there he develops a sight that causes his whole life to change for the worse wonderful movie to have in any video collection it will keep you on your toes and will have you watching it over again ,9

245,EN,-1396280580,i was raised on and by this movie i worshiped it and still do because there nothing else like it out there it a clever and colorful adaptation of the robin hood legend with a zoofull of fun characters it was made during the lull period after classics like sleeping beauty and lady and the tramp but before the era of mermaid so robin hood has that sketchy drawn look like the jungle book and others but it cute and endearing and remains one of my all time favorites it true that lots of furry artists have tainted and soiled it with x rated art i use the term loosely here but it is possible to filter that out and enjoy this movie by itself any kid with imagination will love disney robin hood and any critic will be able to appreciate the studio inventive take on this well traversed tale it a classic ,9
246,EN,-1396280580,this movie was a staple of my childhood however mr disney is probably rolling over in his grave at the poor quality of this animation this film was made after his death the animators were lazy and used many looped clips as well as recycled parts from other scenes and even other movies the music and script were worthy of original animation that being said i still own this movie on vhs and long for the day that i can find it on dvd robin hood and little john walkin through the forest laughin back and forth at what the other had to say never ever thinking there was danger in the water they were drinkin they just guzzled it down ,10
247,EN,402840831,i must have seen kung fu panda either in its entirety or snippets here and there over ## times since its release in #### while its relatively simple tale of an underdog who has been laughed at throughout his entire life learning to fulfil his unexplored potential is nothing new it remains effortlessly entertaining and the kind of film you can catch halfway through and still enjoy what it has to offer although the title promises plenty of fat jokes and there are certainly plenty the film goes beyond simply appealing to kids with sight gags by working in chinese mysticism some wonderful voice acting and stunning animation that would only get better and more ambitious as the series went on clumsy panda po jack black lives in the valley of peace a scenic ancient land in china overlooked by the jade palace home to the legendary kung fu masters while he dreams of joining the furious five a gang of ass kicking kung fu specialists consisting of tigress angelina jolie monkey jackie chan mantis seth rogen viper lucy liu and crane david cross po spends his days making and eating noodles with his father mr ping james hong when he spectacularly enters the palace during the choosing of the would ragon warrior po finds himself picked out by the wise old master oogway randall duk kim as the one to stop to the evil tai lung ian mcshane an escaped snow leopard seeking revenge on master shifu dustin hoffman and his furious five taking inspiration from the chinese kung fu movies of the #### as well as american geek culture kung fu panda works as both as a physical comedy and an action spectacular although the characters frequently defy the laws of physics and seem incapable of getting hurt the action scenes are well choreographed and exciting with mcshane voicing his role with whisker twirling relish there are also hints at backstories and questions raised about po past why on earth is his father a goose and the film is wise enough to leave the answers to future instalments and trusting in its simple introductory tale of a misfit finally finding a home while the majority of the five do not really find a moment to shine individually hoffman lends a certain gravitas to his tragic backstory and relationship with the deadly tai lung the pratfalls will entertain the kids and the gentler moments will no doubt charm the adults something that dreamworks generally fails to do with its animated efforts so it no doubt that the series remains the jewel in it crown ,7
248,EN,-2046401408,the incredibles is by far the best animated film of the year brad bird has directed a movie so good that it is actually being nominated for best screenplay at the academy awards i hope it wins the animation featured in this comic gem is absolutely incredible the animated characters are so real looking that you often forget that they are not real the jokes and gags in this movie are really funny and you are garanteed to laugh your head off it is not a surprise that this movie is funny after all it was directed by one of the producers of the simpsons basically if you like movies that are action packed funny have a great story and have an excellent cast you will love this one of a kind film ,8
249,EN,-2046401408,i know than a lot of people will disagree with me but dude the animations are slow characters are useless plot its ridiculous and senceless antagonists are dumb and everything in the movie its just another ash in the ashtray the worst part it won an oscar that oscar belongs to sharktale or shreck # not to this usseless piece of crap that really pisses me off because that price was buyed buyed i hate that movie and i hate most of the pixar work never thrust the oscars besides the marketing i mean the toys they sale they are crap i really cant believe they did it if its there a sequel it would be twice as bad as this one was ,1
250,EN,-2046401408,this movie could have been so much more unless you are a fan of the technical aspects of animation this movie is a real letdown for all but the preteens if you take your # year old to see this movie i am sure they will enjoy it and want to see it a million more times just look at the box office for y gi unlike the feeling you get from the trailers and promos that is the audience that will be attracted to this movie i left the theater with my brain feeling numb you know that feeling you can get when you have spent a whole saturday morning in front of the tv watching cartoons the feel of the animation is better than saturday morning cartoons but the plot is the same the characters do not develop and the inconsistencies in the plot are horrible it is very obvious that the creators have hopes for a long running series for these characters i could not shake the thought that i was watching a pilot for a bad simpsons instead of a feature length movie for parents of young children this movie will be great as your children will be entertained this is doomed though to be one of those movies you will buy for your children when it comes out on dvd and then have to watch with them thousands of times it lacks the smart type of humor that can transcend between both child and adult so prepare to be bored all in all this is a good movie to entertain your small children but do not expect much on an adult level # of ## for the nice animation work ,1
251,EN,-2744062,totally sickening no redeeming value to the human condition why not study the uplifting people in the world instead of getting a view through the eyes of the most degenerate disgusting and completely perverted few the more glimpses they show into the lives of the debase people of the world the more debase our world becomes ,1
252,EN,-2744062,pulp fiction is good but it not as good as reservoir dogs the reason for this is that after his debut with dogs tarantino no longer felt obliged to make his films in any way realistic i know dogs is derivative and probably not even realistic but there is a certain suspension of disbelief a humbleness in terms of realism that tarantino never felt obliged to observe again i love the bonny situation especially i love many aspects of the film but it too retro and silly dogs is more real and shocking jackie brown i feel he tried again to get the realism but since then has simply not bothered it like he said to himself to hell with it this is the way i am ,10
253,EN,-2744062,going into this for the first time i knew this would be a good movie and i would enjoy it however i had no idea that it would be this good it practically blew me away this movie follows how # people lives are all intertwined in an action packed tale of gun violence drug use and murder what this film is most famous for is its twisted timeline which is never too confusing but also very impressive when i first saw the beginning i did not think much of it and as the film progressed i forgot about it but when it comes back at the ending i knew i was in for a treat the movie has several of these surprises which will knock you out cold and they are made brilliant by its twisting plot i was in awe when the credits first started to roll also this movie has an outstanding soundtrack which is actually pretty recognizable and iconic it is also very well done too i honestly feel that it perfectly fits the movie like jaws when i think of this movie the soundtrack which played during the end credits instantly plays in my head it may not be as iconic as jaws music but it definitely is of equal quality also the acting could not be much better in my opinion john travolta samuel jackson and bruce willis all gave perfect performances they are all able to convey so many moods at once with their facial expressions and they could not do any better this movie also has very great repeat watchability to it the first viewing of this masterpiece is unforgettable but just like fight club this movie gets better and better every time you watch it mainly because the fact that you know what is going to happen and that you know all of its surprises makes several scenes even more engaging also this movie has so many iconic lines and scenes it super rare for a film to have # iconic scenes but this movie has several of them which have been retold and parodied so many times in pop culture so in conclusion this movie is in fact a masterpiece because of many reasons it has changed cinema so much and it has shown the test of time for over ## years i think that this film is going to be remembered for many more decades also i think that this is tarantino best film and i also think that it is one of the best movies ever made i recommend this to everyone who enjoys action and complex plot structures to movies ,10
254,EN,88588036,i recently saw casino royale and walked away very very impressed i have been a big bond fan since at least the sixth grade and read all the fleming bond novels by grade eight i always saw sean connery in my minds eye as bond but daniel craig did something very impressive he pulled it off he is fleming james bond brought to life a cold arrogant assassin who works for the government craig performance was superb he is james bond now the movie took liberties with the book which i recently re read but i was so surprised by the fact that while they made changes to the story they kept the flavor of the book they kept it gritty and action packed did this movie keep my attention yes will i see it again yes am i a fan of the daniel craig james bond yes let hope the next few bond he makes are as good as this one or if not better ,10
255,EN,88588036,i am not bonds biggest fan even if i am british and i have seen a few but this could quite easily convert me this is all action adrenalin pumping cinematography i am going to make a bold statement maybe and say craig is the best bond to date he may lack the swarve sophistication of connery or brosnan but he really delivers an all action performance i was slightly sceptical at his appointment as the new bond but then i could not think of a better option also but any doubts were pushed aside after about ## minutes his acting is decent even for a bond film and deserves a mention for this i think but on top of his decent acting he defines action le chiffre is a top villain ice cold and clever and the bond girls are top notch not a big fan of eva green pre bond but i certainly am now the opening credits are stylish and being a graphic designer i appreciate them and their artistic values up there with kiss kiss bang bangs for me the story was solid and the cheesiness was limited and although it is a bond trademark it was nice to see it reduced being a part time poker player the poker scene was maybe the let down with the ################# # situation but the cards aside the interaction between the characters at the table was intriguing overall this is my favourite bond to date and daniel craig has arrived although i personally have always enjoyed his films a big # for this one and thank you for getting this so so right,10
256,EN,88588036,the stunts were amazing and kept me on the edge of my seat i saw the first show at ##am in irvine ca the theater was almost full and a neighbor asked me if i called in sick at work with bondflu the czech actress was gorgeous however the main actress was full of yin energy audience specially seemed to have enjoyed the bond torture scene being a gambler at heart i loved the casino mix daniel craig was superb i wish his first name was craig for he is so much a craig than a daniel while craig seems to have a cold look you know he is all warm and gooey inside if you liked craig in layercake you will absolutely adore this movie and come out feeling all warm and heartfelt ,10
257,EN,88588036,right now it is somewhat hard for me to write this comment without giving any spoilers but i have marked it with a a spoiler tag just in case somebody thinks this has a spoiler in it i saw this last night with a bunch of my friends after watching the movie we came to the conclusion that it has been a while where a bond movie has not been totally about some hot chick with a bizarre name or gadgets that somehow work their way into the plot the execution of all the stunts was great any gadgetry was minimal and quite believable and most of all daniel craig is quite ripped to all the nay sayers about craig yes in the trailers he looks somewhat weak and a little short but whenever there is a scene with him without a shirt he is very built not only shown by a very defined six pack but also by great muscle definition in his arms and legs the other thing that craig brought to the movie was his sense of style he was able to play an egotistical head case and a gentleman without a change in how he acted ,10
258,EN,88588036,i am sure many will disagree with this review still here my take first daniel craig is a great james bond a lot of the movie works but i had several complaints and in the end i had to say i did not really like it at least not enough to want to go see it again in the near future biggest complaint this movie is way too long and it drags near the end the main romance was not terribly believable given the way things were set up characters would enter with little to no background or setup then have a major plot impact seemingly out of the blue at the end of the movie i discussed it with several friends and we could not even decide who one of the main characters was supposed to be or untangle another character likely motivation or what happened in a third scene by the end i was left emotionally detached the movie does a lot of things right but a lot of other things wrong and for me on balance i cannot recommend it ,4
259,EN,1439058182,this was a wonderful movie although some of the more adult scenes could be limited and the end was rather predictable i saw it with some friends who also enjoyed it quite a bit leonardo dicaprio did a great job boosting his image after such titles as the beach tom hanks was great as well i cannot wait to see it again once it is released on vhs or dvd somewhat long but it feels like # smaller movies all rolled into one large package younger people may not understand most of what is going on but the story is good nonetheless bits of humor are added to make it even more crowd appealing overall it was a very good movie a good reenactment of the true story at least from what i have heard and it deserves some recognition ,8
260,EN,-195188985,there is no denying the excellence of al pacino performance nor the entertainment value of the movie that said i would suggest that readers try finding a copy of the film scent of a woman was based on the italian made profumo di donna starring vittorio gassman gassman interpretation is much different and the film though a comedy in the universal sense more serious gassman character is an unlikeable failure with little to recommend him the intrusive prep school subplot in pacino version makes no appearance in the italian unfortunately profumo di donna has yet to be released on dvd only on vhs your search will be more than worth the effort as will your time spent watching the film ,8
261,EN,-195188985,thank god pacino finally received the oscar statue he so rightfully deserved in all the years he was in the acting business it nice to know the academy finally came to their senses and awarded him a best actor oscar for this landmark role this is one of his most memorable performances and i am sure when people think pacino they think about his portrayal of the blind colonel slade hoo ha the movie itself is not technically great very good but not great the plot is quite predictable and driven via patented hollywood devices the courtroom climax contains one of pacino most powerful monologues however its outcome is melodramatic personally i thought the whole idea of pacino being more perceptive of the world than any man or woman with perfect eyesight was far fetched and sometimes more implausible than stunning i am sure there are blind men in the world who are in fact very perceptive to what goes on in the world but few if any who can recall a whole history triggered simply by the sound of one voice how is he able to tell chris o would onnell has pimples he not handicapped by blindness this guy has psychic powers he does not need sight i do have to say that some of the most memorable lines come from this movie pacino says some original and wildly funny monologues involving subject matter i cannot discuss in this message and of course there the timeless quote hoo ha which later became a pacino trademark scent of a woman is a somewhat flawed but effective and entertaining film it a must see for pacino fans everywhere it not everyday you can catch a performance this powerful my score # out of ## ,9
262,EN,-195188985,al pacino has made many fine movies and i feel that this was his best effort in a role that was not the usual the scenes where he goes to dinner with his babysitter and dances with the lovely woman and then the finale at the school were very moving highly entertaining ,10
263,EN,-813589240,this is really gritty intense and poignant film making it is the top movie of the year so far with some scenes that should be remembered for a long time some people might think it uses too many conventions i say posh all the performances are successful and every big moment is shot in such a correctly unique way that we are not let go from the movie the scene with matt dillon and thandie newtown in the car accident was brilliant as was the subtle and simple film score the digital camera work was also technically masterful this will definitely be on my top ten list at the end of the year and if it not then we have been blessed with a really good movie year i applaud haggis for his debut i cannot think of many others who started off with such confidence ,8
264,EN,-813589240,i was blown away by this movie i am not a seasoned film critic by any means but i wanted to express just how much and what i loved about this film i loved it on so many levels my husband and i watched it last night and it prompted so much discussion on how people from all cultures form stereotypes of other cultures the movie made us laugh at times it made us cringe cry and wipe sweat off our brows i was very pleased with the cast chosen and even more pleased with the superb job they did in acting the parts i loved the no frills raw look of the film i really enjoyed the emotional soundtrack score as well best of all the movie made us really think and that folks is very rare these days for a motion picture to do that ,10
265,EN,-813589240,absolutely amazing i had no expectations going into this movie because i had not seen any advertisement for it i would like to think of myself as impartial for that reason i was absolutely stunned by this movie floored it was one of the most jarring pieces of film i have ever witnessed i was supposed to go to a friends party right afterward but i just could not do it the movie left me in a state that i just could not stop thinking about myself and everything that i do i even cried i have seen movies all my life and not once cried in a theatre obviously it wo not have the same effect on everyone and a lot of people wo not like it but whoever and wherever you are i would recommend seeing it you might learn a thing or two about yourself ,10
266,EN,-813589240,perhaps the most striking and jarring stereotype revealed by this film is the filmmaker own apparent belief that the american public is completely incapable of understanding subtlety this is not so much a movie as a sledgehammer assault to the head i was not offended as a white person or as a woman or as a resident of los angeles but as an intelligent person capable of comprehending undertone facial expression and unforced dialogue while haggis makes the astute observation that our quotidian lives are charged with many levels of racial prejudice and misunderstanding the words coming from these characters mouths are as misplaced as the movies that attempt to have modern characters speaking in iambic pentameter who are the characters in crash certainly not any of the angelenos i know no one spends their entire day pontificating about race even if the subject is always there bubbling just under the surface no one uses these characters vocabulary nobody is so one dimensional is it too much to ask that hollywood create a movie that deals with race without making race itself the only character with any sort of definition and development why are we hit over the head with the concept of race but leave the theater wondering who the hell those poor souls were and on which vacuous studio lot in whose overly eager brain we can find them ,5
267,EN,922129673,in the tradition of sixth sense an intriguing and challenging view of social stigmas and expectations this story is quite a statement about social acceptance and an insight into the terrible affliction schizophrenia worth a watch but do not expect anything you will be wrong ,9
268,EN,922129673,there no doubt that fight club is one of my favorite movies its attractive and original style its trapping story its performances its ending and its message turn this sequence of images with sound into an authentic masterpiece i consider this film to be one of the best of all times fincher tells us the story of an unnamed character the narrator who has entirely devoted to his job and whose life completely lacks of meaning this guy who is very well interpreted by edward norton suffers from insomnia and cannot find the solution to his problem he becomes addicted to attending support groups and pretending to be a victim which at first seems to be the cure to his sleeping disorder but the presence of another impostor named marla singer helena bonham carter ruins everything norton starts feeling uncomfortable the narrator meets the man who is going to help him solve his problem tyler durden brad pitt durden will try to open edward eyes he will teach him how to leave everything behind how to forget about the material stuff in order to discover the meaning of his life they will co found an underground club known as fight club this film is the story of us the story of everyone this is a love tale that camouflaged by a critic to capitalism and consumerism talks about the pursuit of happiness talks about finding the right person the person that takes out our best selves it is a story that strengthens values such us compromise conviction devotion determination and love ten out of ten,10
269,EN,922129673,the masterpiece movie fight club is rather an interesting movie if you have ever seen this movie before watch it again and pay close attention and once you have done that watch it again and pay closer attention you may be surprised by what you see i guarentee it fight club is believe it or not closely related to fascism and the ways of adolf hitler if you ever have time you should study up on what hitler said back in ww# and then compare those words tyler durden from fight club used in fight club there is many more interesting things on how much adolf and tyler have in common check it out sometime you would be surprised ,10
270,EN,922129673,this is an excellent movie even though many people never understood what it was about and many thought that it was a pointless action movie what makes this movie excellent is that it not an action movie per se but more of a psychological and philosophical journey into the mind of every male bored and tired of their own lives you know who i am talking about the ones that are stuck in dead end jobs stuck with a commanding wife that treats em like dirt and want something better and the ones that are alone with no one in sight to comfort them the material things do not help em feel better and that why the narrator feels like he does until he meets tyler durden the fights in fight club only help release all the male rage inside which would help most of us if there are chick flicks well now you can say there is a dude flick i know all these comments have been posted before but this is my first post ,10
271,EN,922129673,the book was absolutely genius and of course the movie is too this movie is so whacked and also so interesting that you do not know whether to laugh or to cry at the end and whether the end is disastrous catastrophic or very pretty it was an experience watching this one it actually has a very strange mixture of extremes a band of stressed people that develop a very very dangerous and strange hobby that turns into a sort of religion a schizo who is brain damaged and does not even know it the most weird love hate relationship you have ever seen and the most weird dubious and scary characters put together in just one movie but it remains a very original and exciting film to watch what can i say if it edward norton it bound to be a good movie ,10
272,EN,922129673,this is without a doubt the best movie i have ever seen the performances of everyone in the cast from the smallest bit the priest to brad pitt tyler durden are unbelievably believable the story is told and strung together in a way that i have never seen done better before i understand that some people are not able to handle violence but every single second of this film is needed to achieve the goal that was so perfectly attained ,10
273,EN,327575819,given that this was made so soon after sin city one cannot deny the possibility that a reason for making it was the popularity and widespread success of the aforementioned film both are based on comics of frank miller both are bloody and packed with adrenaline and style however regardless of what may or may not have been in the minds of the producers this movie is entertaining and fulfilling whilst not as well rounded and perfectly executed as sin city it has plenty of action cool shots and intensity to go around i have not read the original comic book so i cannot comment on how well this tells the story that miller not the historians do not make the mistake of confusing this film for an actual account of events intended but i can say that it pulls off the comic book feel pretty darn well the visuals are simply stunning and the movie is filled just about to the very brink with gorgeous designs and camera work that amazes the many boxes of text found in most comic books are translated to the medium of film with a narrator and it works remarkably well i was worried early on that the narrator would remain for all of the film but i found it to not only mesh with the visuals but improve the overall experience the music is part orchestrated score and all fits exceptionally well the pacing was flawless the acting i found to be masterful for just about every part the dialog varies but the majority is good the grandiose speeches and the serious tone of them is lightened pleasantly through occasional wit the battles are massive bad ass and often quite bloody though there was less gore than i had expected but i did not mind i would guess that big parts of the audience are comprised of people coming mainly for the battles and i would say that most will leave the theater satisfied the sequences of fighting are long stylized well choreographed and wickedly cool i found the rest of the movie to be interesting and engaging and i would not say that the fights are too long one thing i really liked and that got the movie and frank miller my respect was the way the spartan women were depicted strong passionate and as full of courage and fortitude as the men whether or not this is historically accurate i do not know but that miller and the movie would depict women that way is something i can only support and encourage the movie was not perfect however some shots were less spectacular than they could or should have been and the last battle was perhaps a little disappointing still this is a movie that i urge anyone who enjoys action macho ism and comic book style to watch i strongly recommend this to any fan of comic books and any man into action # ##,8
274,EN,327575819,why so many people walk into the theater expecting a historically accurate movie is beyond me so what if there were not really any rhinos or elephants so what if the movie was full of hunchbacks and strange looking people the fact is that the cinematography and direction was superb there has not been anything that revolutionary since the matrix the movie was made to entertain me not educate me if i wanted a history lesson i will go the library or watch the history channel if this movie did not have the cgi or the exaggeration it would just be another troy or kingdom of heaven we have seen that a million times before this was different i was thoroughly entertained ,9
275,EN,327575819,this film was based on the frank miller graphic novel of the same name and visually it lived up to the hype exceptional cinematography and a strong performance by gerard butler make this an almost amazing film unfortunately weak side stories and little character development hamper any true involvement by the audience this is not to say that it not entertaining the classic idea of a small force of free men defeating an enormous overwhelming opponent is stirring and inspiring especially because it is based on true events the over the top nature of the graphic novel comes through in a clear fashion with big screen visuals and # # audio that lives up to the source material thermopylae was one of the first examples of independent city states banding together to face a totalitarian foe certainly worth making a movie about ,7
276,EN,-1582925551,fed up of only being able to have brief trysts in hotel rooms with her long distance lover sam loomis marion crane decides to take the forty thousand dollars her bosses client has given her to deposit at the bank and head to california to be with him and start a new life however the drive from arizona to california is a long one and after she is questioned by a cop for sleeping in her car at the side of the road she decides to check into the nearest motel the next time she is tired she stops at the bates motel run by norman played by anthony perkins who did such an outstanding job at playing him that it apparently type cast him for the rest of his career and his crotchety overbearing house bound mother lonely norman seems grateful for the company and invites marion to eat with him where he reveals more about himself and his unhealthy relationship with his mother after the conversation takes an unnerving turn marion excuses herself and retires to her room where she takes the fateful shower in which mrs bates who is apparently displeased at her presence in the motel viciously stabs her to death upon discovering marion lifeless body norman decides to protect his mother and covers up her crime he hides marion and her belongings including the forty thousand dollars which she had hidden inside a rolled up newspaper in the boot of her car and drives the car into a nearby swamp marion disappearance prompts her sister lila to start a police investigation but when the detective goes missing as well lila decides to trace her sister last steps for herself appealing to her sister lover to help her they head to the bates motel where they discover the disturbing truth behind norman and his mother often credited as being the first slasher film psycho is by far one of the most influential movies of all time the twist ending where it is revealed that norman is the real killer and assumes his dead mother identity to commit murder has been mimicked and parodied so many times but was considered very shocking and perverse at the time it was made hearing the detective describe norman as a transvestite stood out to me when i first watched the movie as it was so unusual to hear the term in a movie that was released during that time and it very nearly was not as the mpaa allegedly tried to cut it from the film ,8
277,EN,-1582925551,being a fan of horror films i realised that i had not actually watched one of the biggest horror films that ever existed psycho i was really reluctant to watch it because it an old film and i am so accustomed to all of the new horror films that are appearing all over our screens but i finally purchased the dvd and sat down with a big bowl of popcorn and galaxy chocolate to watch it i have to say taking everything into account it is my favourite horror film of all time why not just because it was in black and white and is a classic but because it so simple and easy to follow and there no gimmicks the story is believable and haunting and so refreshing to watch at a time when the world is so advanced and modern with technology being capable of anything but this film had no special effects it was art in its purest form and i adored the film alfred hitchcock is a genius in portraying a really sinister plot in such a clever straightforward way and it really hones in what it really takes to make a film truly compelling i felt it was such an honour to watch anthony perkins on screen portray such an intriguing character in such a successful way he really captured the essence of the character and made the film a true gem i am not going to give away any spoilers but i have to say that psycho is the best horror film ever made and the storyline is beautiful in its simplicity and shock factor it will keep you on the edge of your seat and the ending is just wow ,9
278,EN,-1582925551,a near perfect film that few today can see in its intended state ie not knowing anything about it hitch masterfully lulls is into thinking the film will be about a girl who takes off with a load of money yet that has no relevance to the film in the slightest other than to scare the hell out of you when she dies i actually watched this film not knowing that norman bates was his mother and ultimately gained more from the film than a lot of people that i know have watched it perfect score to the film by bernard herrmann which adds to the tension see especially the music as marion is driving in the rain and note how the windscreen wipers are a metaphor for the knife the rain is also used like the water from the shower almost hinting at what will follow superb film from the master of suspense ## ##,10
279,EN,-1582925551,some people say that this the best film ever well i agree this was good and the plot was so good it left me guessing all the way through but probably the only bad thing about it is that its one of those films where you watch it once and thats it because you already know whats going to happen and it kind of spoils the whole film when you watch it again what really surprised me was that the blood from the notorious hower scene was actually chocolate syrup for me after north by northwest this was hitchcock best piece of work every movie has a bit where it probably would never happen and psychos is the death where the detective gets stabbed at the top of the stairs and manages to slide all of the way down them again backwards but other than that i say well done to the great alfred hitchcock,10
280,EN,-870195436,i expected much better for another scorsese dicaprio collaboration the movie starts out well i was immediately pulled into what seemed like an interesting story where we would have a super sleuth investigating a incident and cracking down antagonists one by one instead it turned into a psychological thriller that reminded me all too much of other recent psychological thrillers making it run of the mill i thought the movie took far too long to wrap everything up this could have been done in an hour and forty minutes time many of the long dream sequences could have been shortened they were not effective anyway and fall short when compared with bernard hermann music backed dream sequence of vertigo which is what scorsese was going for i think this movie is overrated and the director and lead actor involved have done much more impressive things in their careers both respectively and together ,5
281,EN,-1959729897,you people are either brainwashed or just plain ignorant to what constitutes great cinema first of all # hour bank heist epics should never be made period secondly cut out every scene with a woman in it save for the one with the stand in get away driver and his wife discussing the struggles of staying clean and away from crime the women are utterly useless to the overall story and ruin the pace of the film third the waingro storyline was laughable if these guys are such pros then why are they trying to whack this guy in a very public diner parking lot this after making a scene in the diner assuring dozens of witnesses and finally the scene between pacino and deniro completely forced and does not further the story at all which is actually the point of scene construction the telling of the story and not to be picky but that would never happen in real life either which is not such a big deal until you compound it with all the other flaws in the movie overall the most overrated movie of the ## easily ,10

283,EN,1362625306,it hard to believe i have seen so many movies yet i have never seen a woody allen film it just never came to my mind but annie hall is probably his most famous work and i figured that at least i could see this film since it won best picture against star wars while i am still debating if it was the best picture of #### i still cannot deny that this was an excellent film the story was so wonderful and really opened the doors for the battle of the sexes i do not think a film before this could have depicted such a better way of the way we think of the opposite sex alvy singer is a comedian slightly famous he does everything right in his career he always has the right lines a great apartment in new york a fun imagination but with the ladies well there he becomes more short handed but that all changes when alvy meets a naive but lovely woman annie hall she is a singer who is trying to make it but when he and she become an item she opens up more and wants to do more but alvy just would prefer to keep things the way they are the film is really remarkable and i have to say that i could understand it praise the story still remains so true to this day and any adult could really understand it premisous i loved the scene where both annie and alvy are at their therapists and they explain that the sex they are having is either not enough or too much there are so many classic scenes i would just recommend this film it a great classic that anyone could enjoy # ##,9
284,EN,1362625306,woody is not much of an actor except when he plays himself but he is an occasionally brilliant writer he and marshall brickman collaborated on annie hall which may be the best screenplay ever written there is not one wasted word in the whole script perhaps the greatest gag ever was when woody produces marshall mcluhan out of a movie line to contradict a loud mouth columbia college professor standing behind him if real life could only be like this in addition the separation of spirit from body was a brilliant gag and nobody can cook a lobster like alvie the cinematography is gorgeous and the performances are splendiforous la di da la di da this is not my favorite woody allen movie love and death takes that honor but it was his best the academy took a lot of flak for the oscar nod but i could not imagine a world where woody did not win an oscar this was his oscar worthy movie unfortunately he has fallen short of duplicating this high level of film making ever since ,10

286,EN,2035323681,any who may have read some of my comments on ## films will have noticed that they are generally favourable for me criticism is largely a matter of imparting enthusiasms what point is there is wasting time on castigating indifferent or downright bad movies when one could be encouraging someone to make discoveries that have brought me great joy and excitement just occasionally i have made an example of something that could have been better handled in more skilled hands arlington road tea with mussolini and the italian version of chekhov three sisters but generally i have stuck to ones that i playfully categorise as fooqs films of outstanding quality the really great ones or foqs films of quality not really great but having qualities that make them well worth seeing just for once however i am going against this by writing about something i find really dreadful not one that deserves to pass unnoticed as the type of mindless cretin fodder that runs the circuits every week but one made by an art house director not without talent who should have known better lars von trier work is never less that controversial even his finest breaking the waves had me ultimately questioning the value of a film whose considerable grip bordered on the morbidly sensational nevertheless its powerful impact was such as to stifle criticism and place it among the top ten of its particular year i can offer no such accolade to the truly appalling dancer in the dark although i somehow managed to watch it to the end why because as with its predecessor it has a certain compulsive quality shared by some other bad movies such as titanic which makes it impossible to put down most bad movies however are harmless time wasters von trier dancer is something different and rather dangerous as it trivialises very serious themes such as blindness and capital punishment by dressing them up pretentiously in the escapist popular genre of the musical the film is never less than skillful but at what price every ounce of chaplinesgue mawkishness is poured into the character of the factory worker who hopes to make enough money to pay for an operation to save her son sight in a race against time as blindness rapidly overtakes her and what of the conclusion on death row where a song and dance routine prefaces the final drop hard to believe that we are actually witnessing an event as horrendous as the inevitable outcome of kieslowski a short film about killing to cheapen it as von trier does here is nothing short of obscene ,10

289,EN,-1291350746,admittedly i had certain expectations going to see this movie some of them were met some were exceeded and then some were not i will start off with the bad just to get them out of the way i will include a fact or two from the movie but hopefully nothing important the biggest problem i had with this movie is that the director seemed so fixated on the period piece rather than the friendship between erik and charles that it almost felt at times that the mutants were an afterthought in comparison to the plot of creating another world war there was very little delving into their friendship let alone the creation of the x men team i am sorry but one week of training is not enough to teach havok or banshee to control their powers i will trust that is what the sequel will be for though the concept of the outcasts of us vs them and peace vs war was played up nicely the tension was obvious from the start and the blind ignorance that is to blame was also obvious even a bit too obvious the writers did a great job at skimming the surface of the problems to come so i hope that the sequel also delves into the causes of this ignorance more what would also be nice is too really see how magneto and professor x deal with these issues on their own terms mcavoy and fassbender steal any scene they are in whether together or separately the best thing for this movie was to cast these two together that being said i do believe that mcavoy and fassbender were not used to their full potential what little time you do see the two together philosophizing was never enough given their chemistry on screen i just wish more time had been spent on these things rather than shaw plot but when you have someone like kevin bacon in a movie any movie who knows how to play up a character like shaw you cannot waste him every move bacon made as shaw every expression made and line spoken with a specific tone of voice was delivered flawlessly over all i would watch the movie again not because of the plot but because of it three main actors and the strengths each of them brought to their characters when each of them was on screen as eric charles or shaw i believed them the score i gave this movie was because of them as for the remaining supporting cast they did their jobs well enough lucas till as havok jones as banshee and hoult as beast definitely stood out though i know i am not the only one to say that i had gotten use to kelsey grammar as beast it was obvious that january jones as frost was there as nothing more than eye candy given she played the role with nothing more than a straight face kudos to lawrence for playing raven in full body makeup as much as she did she did an excellent job as someone struggling with her identity the remaining characters came and went even rose byrn and zoe kravitz byrn was given very little to work with while kravitz was given more screen time than what was needed for her character ,9

303,EN,-445029751,chaplin movies are always concentrated on the misery and sorrow of ordinary people his famous tramp is presented as the core common man in most of his movies like gold rush modern times etc according to me the best chaplin movie is the great dictator but as tramp it city lights which captures the grace of chaplin at peak story picks a tramp and his romantic interest a flower girl his attempts to support the gave gives way to so many hilarious situations as an addition there is an eccentric millionaire his butler and a boxing match behind every laugh there will be a stinging pain and chaplin successfully captured the woes and worries of the men who lived in this world with the best as he could words wo not be enough to praise the artist in chaplin since he is one of the pioneers of world cinema there are no wonder that he made these movies brilliant because that what he had experienced in his childhood he conjured his suffering days into the celluloid and we are calling them classics even after all these years we wonders sighs laughs with the tramp and the master behind all these will be laughing too from heavens ,9

305,EN,-1811637160,spoilers ahead spike lee malcolm x is a highly worthy biographical drama that rightfully stands alongside gandhi as a timeless classic this movie goes deeply into the life of malcolm x and analyses the decisions he made in life that led him to be one of the most important figures in the american civil rights movement this movie does not shy away from discussing such important events as malcolm chickens coming home to roost speech regarding jfk assassination which resulted in him being silenced by black muslim leader elijah mohammed malcolm pilgrimage to mecca his conversion to mainstream islam and his gradual realization that not all white men are evil and that even christianity need not be rejected as a spiritual guide for black people was shown so subtly and gradually that the audience can accept such a transformation as credible the audience sees malcolm x evolution as a human being and they are convinced that while he was a genuine and powerful leader within the black muslim religion and a heartfelt spokesman for their cause he was also a consistently evolving person filled with self doubt and prone to making mistakes spike lee has done in excellent job in presenting the full story of the life of malcolm x while also humanizing him and even going so far as to counter the criticisms that malcolm was a spokesman for violence and racial hatred as opposed to martin luther king jr message or racial equality and peaceful civil disobedience the movie shows that malcolm sermons and viewpoints were much more complex than simply advocating racial separation spike lee analyses malcolm views with such details that the viewer will at least empathize with malcolm and understand his speeches and why he felt the way he felt i highly recommend this movie for people interested in american history or those who are simply fans of biopics this was a movie that was worth all the hype it received back in #### ,9
306,EN,-769391302,here is a movie that really set up a high level of expectations by huge advertising and hype some people tend to look at it through the scope of trailers and expectations but in case of fury they should not sure having brad pitt in a new war movie creates enough hype itself but if you want to enjoy a new movie do not come expecting an all time blockbuster just because you saw a great trailer that why many people bash this movie at start i must say that i enjoyed the movie all along there were some slow paced moments but later you see why they fit in and build the story sure driving around in tank is not much of an excitement and nothing we have not seen before but it the really emotional moments that make this movie stand out in it genre for example when don makes norman kill a nazi soldier the apartment scene and the preparation in the tank for the last battle action scenes are average with the exception of the tiger vs three sherman tanks which was really realistic what really drives the movie is the connection of brad pitt and logan lerman logan as norman is the key here brad as usually delivers a fine act and he almost completely becomes this allied war veteran while logan is i dare say even more convincing john bernthal was also a key ingredient in the crew chemistry shia labeouf and others are not worth mentioning this movie may have unrealistic battles but that not what it about fury brilliantly shows what it means to be a soldier in a tank crew and having your life hanging on a thread being prepared to die any second again norman as a rookie who have not killed anyone before and don as a veteran make it great character development is good and steady and some scenes will make you even cry for the unrealistic last battle i give it # ## do not miss it ,8

330,EN,-1261130941,most horror thriller movies see how far they can go to scare the hell out of a person they will usually start with a grisly murder or something that foreshadows the many grisly murders that will occur during the movie though this formula can sometimes be effective it gets old and sour faster than you can scream bloody murder the sixth sense however defies all the conventional horror rules instead of putting together a series of unlikely events that ends up as a bloodbath at the end it slowly draws the audience into its web of mystery and thrills though it does start with an event that foreshadows events in the movie it does it in a way that nobody will expect in a tense yet nuanced style it keeps you enthralled in the plotline while finally blowing you away at the end the performances are oscar caliber at least by ## year old actor haley joel osment though bruce willis performance is not bad and a very refreshing change from his usual action fare its this kid that carries the movie and drives the emotion home highly recommended ,10
331,EN,-1261130941,it was a super hot monday afternoon when my best friend and i curled up on her couch and watched the sixth sense on her computer dvd i had wanted to see this movie because i adore bruce willis and i wanted to see how he performed in this movie i am an actress and like watching how other actors and actresses handle their rolls and lines i walked away from this movie wanting to be a film director why because it was the director who made this film incredible now do not get me wrong haley joel osment was outstanding i want to see him in more lead rolls more often a kid with that much talent should be around more bruce was awesome as always but the director should win an award the red factor notice the red things in lots of scenes the boy has on a red sweater at the party the red anti depressant pills and so on also the way everything is set up so bruce does not have to move or do anything in public and the ending well i had known the ending when i watched this movie but still it was incredible i am in love with this movie in love i am ,10
332,EN,-1261130941,sorry but this movie did not do it for me at all i did not watch it then and only rented it because i thought well what if i am actually missing something truth is i probably am missing something to me it was just plain boring the kid played well i thought as for mr willis for me he works best in other lighter movies music was ok nothing overwhelming but it did work i liked the camera and lighting of the film too bad i wasted time on this should have known better the next time i will just have to listen to my instincts more closely as usually they are right on the money ,2
333,EN,1140523496,this movie is one of my all time favorites the casting is perfect and goodman role suits him like a i am all out of metaphors it just perfect in fact the more i think about it everything about the movie is perfect great story telling very funny movie do not miss out ,10
334,EN,857181512,i love scorsese films sure his films are violent male oriented but beautiful filmmaking yet i began to be bothered in the departed by his repeated use of the f word in the script it was distracting from a great story great acting but wolf was something else an hour of relentless f wording and brutal sexist behavior toward women was enough for me i walked out mr scorsese you are starting if not already losing some of your best admirers by this to me it reflects a screenwriter who thinks he needs to use explicit language to make a film about a bad guy interesting to audiences might i suggest you get your screenwriters together in one room and watch the entire series of breaking bad to see how to write a great script no profanity no sexist drivel just creative language for a great actor to speak and to build his bad ass character as someone we will never forget ,1
335,EN,857181512,the film does go on a bit i mean how many drug fuelled orgies do i want to see in # # hours one or two would get the depraved lifestyle point across but you see a lot more than that the shock factor wears off and seeing people having sex in an office setting ends up as just boring you know jordan is doing wrong but you cannot dispute his energy and enthusiasm and what he achieves and then you wonder if so much energy and enthusiasm is fuelled by living in a moral vacuum i left the cinema curiously energised and hating myself for having too many morals i will never have a yacht with a helipad i will always have debts i probably wo not ever have a rolex and chanel suits i will never go to prison and hurt people though and i can sleep soundly at night scorsese says this film does not glorify jordan lifestyle but he a pretty remorseless character when i googled him there he is in real life living his new life bragging about how he is a changed man but somehow i think it may be his highly enchanting sales patter that we are seeing rather than real feeling would a truly sorry person want to show his face to the camera if he realised how duplicitous he had been probably not this film is definitely worth watching though just to see what leo does with the character and he really does do a good job i think it an oscar worthy role for leo the film just goes on a bit too long with too many tacky scenes but i guess his life was tacky so what else could scorsese show us leo is the best thing about this film he nailed the character and in my opinion he one role closer to an oscar ,7

337,EN,1165106914,the story goes that future hollywood scribe blatty while a student attending the jesuit university at georgetown back in #### came across a curious item in the washington post involving a ## year old mt rainier youth plagued by demons not the psychological or drug addled kind but the bona fide supernatural variety undergoing the ancient ritual of exorcism the casting out of said demons flash forward after years of paying his dues in hollywood blatty would later base certain aspects of the incident mostly entailing the ritual and cant involved as the basis for his runaway bestseller the exorcist oscar winning filmmaker friedkin the french connection realized it as the perfect follow up as he was on a winning streak and the rest as they say is cinema history it was certainly a blockbuster when it premiered in #### and has earned its reputation as the scariest movie ever made over the years those unseen forces and invisible agencies for both good and evil notwithstanding it also quality filmmaking the effects by marcel vercoutere are more mechanical in nature rather than those effects involving traveling mattes matte art etc but are no less compelling in its depiction of bilious graphic horror a later reissue was retouched using a few digital effects and the demonic makeup by dick smith goes beyond grotesque it downright sickening not to mention language so strong it would make david mamet shrivel up in a corner and die but it was those powerful four letter invectives along with other aspects of the script that won blatty his coveted oscar for best screenplay ,9

340,EN,-221698225,greetings from lithuania terminator #### is a true classic and one of the most important movies ever created by important i mean that it started lots of things which later became very common in cinema itself there is not anything new that i could write about this picture that was was not said hundred times before everything in this movie works and clicks on all cylinders made only for couple of bucks in terms of today sci fi actionier budget even considering b movies it stuck in people memories forever how did maestro j cameron achieve that here are the main reasons in my opinion original and high concept story very good and believable acting by all involved great script cool action scenes terrific pacing and of course all cudos to all technical stuff effects cinematography and so on the idea was always the driving force behind movie which is now safe to call masterpiece j cameron proofed his genius with his first movie first movie i mean terminator not flying fish stuff j overall as you have already saw this picture many times there is nothing new to say it a true classic in every meaning of this word even now ## years after its release this small budget b movie sci fi flick from ## is still managing to attract audiences if you could check some torrent sites you would always see this film as one of the most down loadable whenever you check it no matter what season is what movies there are it always among the most popular it simply just for one reason a true movie entertainment is timeless and ageless ,10
341,EN,73962833,i realize that in many circles this film is considered an absolute classic and possibly scorsese greatest however over the course of time my perception of this film has changed having read wiseguy by nicholas pileggi i realized that this movie does not conform to the book all that much and tends to stray a great deal while most of the performances are memorable they do not really resemble the actual characters that the story is based on joe pesci performance seems way over the top to me although certain short scenes of his are hilarious overall i would say his performance was overacted deniro frank vincent lorraine bracco and ray liotta turn in very convincing performances and scorsese approach to this film was very unique and well done one of the many overlooked features of this movie is the soundtrack while not quite chronologically correct in some spots it does tend to emphasize certain scenes my major criticism of this film is that way too much time in the second half is devoted to henry drug problem i felt that this segment of his life could have been summed up in one or possibly two scenes but here almost the entire second half of this movie focuses on henry drug addiction and dealing not necessary another criticism is that the famous lufthansa heist is only mentioned here and not shown at all i believe that this above all was the centerpiece in the lives of jimmy burke and henry hill and is not given enough attention i would have preferred to see more detail about the heist and less about henry drug use other than that it a memorable film and worthy of a few viewings but as an all time classic i do not think so ,8
342,EN,73962833,this film shows us a life lived to the excess the tone of the film suggests more a study of social behavior than outright gangster film i have even heard it being classed as a modern day noir whatever it brilliant the acting is amazing the cinematography is top bracket the music is heavenly in it depiction of hell scorcese was born to make this movie it impossible to study it the first few times you watch because it sweeps you up and dumps you down at the end it leaves you breathless there is brutal violence drug use and colourful language but there no use complaining because this is the mafia these are bad people what do you expect told in flashback it is based on the story of henry hill a boy who grows up dreaming of making it in the mafia he works his way into the higher ranks of the organised crime syndicate and through a stunning series of set pieces his coke addled paranoia shows us his downfall and eventual fate there are various voice overs to give the action a sense of perspective but there are so many things going on it best just to let it flow de niro and pesci are at the top of their game and the supporting cast give this film a weight unmatched by many as examples of perfection of the art of film making go not many texts can match goodfellas it utterly enthralling ,10

344,EN,73962833,## years after joe pesci asked do i amuse you it still hard not to be terrified by the selfish cruelty the true story of mob rat henry hill seduces us with raw honesty and a charming matter of fact monologue by ray liotta when lorraine bracco joins in and mirrors the storytelling monologue from the viewpoint of an outsider being charmed into the family and suddenly the gangster genre is taken to new levels robert de niro is masterful as jimmy conway spiraling out of control martin scorcese vision comes across through the inner workings of the copacana to using the beautiful finality of the coda of layla as the lufthansa heist crew are innocently discovered all over the place and these guys are goodfellas that the hypocrisy played out ,10
345,EN,102187349,the hours #### a layered vivid ambitious movie with literary and emotional strains that weave through an eighty year sandwich of parallel stories and some of the acting is just fabulous an excellent movie at the core is the modernist writer virginia woolf famous for being one of the great original voices of literature in the ##th century and for her personal struggle against mental illness which led to her #### suicide shown in the first scene in the movie we know the drama is going to be high and that there is a real history underpinning it all but it fiction too woolf mrs dalloway is being written in the earliest ####s narrative showing woolf herself nicole kidman this book is being read in the second narrative with julianne moore being the reader a ####s housewife with some mental instability of her own and the contemporary #### narrative is a take on the dalloway story with echoes from the other two threads here a writer is dying of aids and his best friend and caretaker nicknamed mrs dalloway for fun is trying to keep him from committing suicide for me it was this last story that made the movie take hold the writer is played by a surprisingly sickly looking ed harris and his friend is played by meryl streep these are two of hollywood great actors the kinds of actors who take on a variety of roles and really change movie to movie and their scenes together are like the best stage dramas you could ask for for this alone the movie is worth soaking up in the ####s world it is kidman who is central and in a real way she is the center of the idea of the movie if not its filming woolf is of course the source of it all and kidman who is no match for streep in her career but who wants to be to her credit pulls off one of her best performances her husband the somber and loving leopold tries to keep woolf healthy both physically by making her eat and mentally by giving her support that he fails ultimately is visible in his body language the actor is stephen dillane besides this key relationship the scenes in ##s are a little stilted as if surviving on the aura of the times more than the events which are minimal until the tragic climax in a similar way the ####s story is dripping with ##s set design and stereotypes of lonely housewives and sweet children and emotional restraint there truth to all this of course but i was there almost as a kid and there was another kind of intensity and life that is somehow missing here moore is rather good though for me a bit trapped by the character she has to play there is a nice twist to this story as it goes which is a tonic to the general dread which brings us back to the current realm and streep and harris and most of all streep who is juggling several balls at once in a masterful another masterful performance there seems to be everything here for a perfect movie including an excellent script the themes themselves are what end up too simplified and frankly too pushy to quite work an extra parallel of a lesbian subplot in each case is interesting and actually helpful some critics did not like it though a bit forced into the ####s version the whole ####s segment kept me thinking of far from heaven with its themes and period set design and julianne moore also released in #### sadly the score by philip glass is a droning intrusive distraction there is a good logic to making a score have no sense of its own era so that it can float across the shifting periods in a unifying way but it that kind of canned glass stuff that can be brilliant at its best but is here insensitive to the movie and weirdly dry in its colorful tunefulness still i say this is one you should watch once and should see again if you think you have seen it enough already there a lot to admire a lot to think about and a lot to digest the best of it is well among the best ,9
346,EN,674928356,this was a really good movie very gripping all of the performances are excellent and it will engage you from the start to the finish from the beginning everything is very downplayed very real i am trying to recall if there were any weak performances but there were not the camera work and direction are first class there is one shot in which the camera just focuses on a tree which was exceptional yeah just a tree but it conveys great mood and atmosphere the ending will leave you satisfied this is certainly not your typical hollywood fare thus the high scores on imdb both the dad and the detective are outstanding i do not really want to write anymore because it might give a lot away but the film is very dark and will keep you engaged throughout ,9

350,EN,1139482938,i wanted to see this film for the longest time i missed the theatrical run and after buying the dvd at walmart and watching it tonight i have to admit i was impressed with the engrossing action it all one hasty road runner epic with barely time to breath the pace is quick and you have to make sure you pay attention or you will miss out on important key points to the plot the miserable barbaric and totally cruel future is there which is the principle theme for these mad max films a world where nobody trusts each other and everything is all about guns violence and saving the precious juice to make vehicles move this time around there beautiful and sacred pregnant women at stake and a hunt for the green place where everything is a utopian grassland and an escape from the desert an exciting goal for the story and even more exciting when there a twist to the dream and the challenge to meet it the violence is non stop and the desperate killing to survive is plainly evident in this film max has flashbacks to the death of his wife and daughter and it too bad the film did not focus more on that allowing the viewer to know the reason for max angry and hauntingly bitter mentality to the bad guys charlize theron is perfect as the rambo female but there no kissing or romantic moments here with max it was a brutal kill or be killed emotion between the two at the beginning but after the chaotic clashes with the raging villains they eventually learned to trust one another the barbaric nuclear wasteland of a despairing future is an old clich but this movie brings a refreshing feel to that by making it into one wild and crazy race in the road warrior the highway chase was saved towards the end along with the climactic finale but here the chase is through the whole movie tom hardy is excellent as max and charlize is equally excellent as the she rambo but the super quick movements of the characters makes it seem like the film was playing on high speed instead of running at a normal rate regardless of the flaws this movie delivers on entertainment and continuous suspense it all on the edge of your seat excitement i highly recommend it ,10
351,EN,1139482938,i have not seen all of mad max movies the franchise is a remake of but i can tell you it was not as good as i thought the movie would be when you see tom hardy charlize theron in a cast you expect a gritty story great acting special effects in the movie are all right but story simply too simplistic never really thrilling for me even violence quotient is nothing special to me best sequence of the movie was right at the start before they roll the starting credits after that it just goes downhill the story started out with a promise of almost schizophrenic episodes of max but after that highlight of the movie is character of nux overshadowing everyone else at the end it just fizzles out worth a one time watch for it vfx laced action sequences though ,5

353,EN,-432074910,having not read the book i can only take from chris mccandless experiences based on what i saw in the film into the wild as a film i found many extraordinary things about it the splendid cinematography is the first that comes to mind many of the performances particularly hal holbrook who was a stand out and the interesting story screenplay that director sean penn had to work with which he painted over a broad canvas i do have some issues with the way it was presented the narration by mccandless sister the passages that flashed across the screen from chris letters to wayne who we really did not get to know much about in the film and the non linear representation of the story these things were too distracting for me too get fully immersed in the proceedings it took me almost a restless hour before i began to settle in and my mind was constantly reminded that i was watching a movie i feel this is due to penn disordered screenplay and self conscious directing style the actor mugging into the camera being aware of who the director was i feel that more of sean penn sensibilities and politics came through rather than that of the lead character and has let the film down slightly the choice of eddie vedder to score some of the music and songs throughout the film and the structure of the screenplay appears to come more from penn own psyche rather than what could have worked better for the films narrative i personally feel a more linear mainstream structure to this film would have benefited the story more the representation of the themes expressed do not appear tempered or balanced enough too anti this and anti that again it felt like too much penn coming through william hurt and marcia gay harden had thankless roles as mccandless parents and were wasted screen time any other lesser known actors could have portrayed these roles with what little they were given to do as was with vince vaughn character catherine keener was perfect along with hal holbrook and i did not have any issue with young emile hirsch in the lead role through the events portrayed in the film i admire mccandless tenacity and passion for pursuing the life and dream he desired however i found him arrogant and deluded not to mention hypocritical in denouncing the so called civilized world into which he was born alright chris had some childhood upbringing issues but who does not he was educated intelligent and loved but many of his actions particularly those involving his family appear selfish after the distressing incident with the moose chistopher mccandless should have surrendered his ego and made an attempt to turn back home to my mind he is not a hero and does not deserve to be martyred it was a shame how this bright young mans life ended up but perhaps his fate was deserved ,7

356,EN,-583022231,star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning not being an obsessive fan of the original series films i cannot go into a massive rant about how faithful unfaithful this new film has been to gene roddenberry original vision the whole point of it in the first place was to revamp and relaunch it for a new generation many of whom of course were not even around when it first came out and so director jj abrams has given us his new vision of the series and actually appears to have both kept the spirit and tone of the original series alive whilst also giving the first film in the new series an edginess and vitality that may have been lacking first time around the considerable length is matched out by a lively cast list to match the institution the original stamped each of the new actors brings their new roles to life with that bit more edge from chris pine wise cracking smart arsey but fearless kirk to zachary quinto brilliantly nerdish unfeeling spock with leonard nimoy popping up as him in the future likewise supporting players bruce greenwood as kidnapped commander pike and eric bana as the villainous romulan nero give added gusto in their respective intrepid good guy ruthless bad guy roles plus there ben cross instantly recognizable as spock dad and simon pegg clearly having a great time as a less chubby scott winona ryder was also in it but i must say i did not recognize her the opening takes it time to grow on you with not the most interesting dialogue or snazzy writing which does not improve much further into it really but stick with it and as the film considerable length waves on it will slowly absorb you drawing you more into the story as it goes on with as expected some fantastic special effects and costume design should just about appeal to trekkies and non trekkies alike ,9

358,EN,-583022231,i cannot believe this movie got into top ### i watched it finally few days ago from start to finish it was a masochistic torture to see beloved characters turned into a joke and keep watching it not to mention the resemblance of the story to star wars which is just slap in a face because there were so many other ways to make new star trek movie and they go for sw ripoff i wo not go into all the other stuff cause many other reviewers mentioned a lot of it my biggest problem is lack of real star trek story and trying to replace it with effects and violence ### ### ### dollars and this is all you could think of why would someone who hates star trek be given a chance to make this joke of a movie whose only connection to trek are the names why not make another generic blockbuster that just like this one has nothing to do with star trek at all names included it would not make so much profit i guess cause some john doe in space with cgi and mindless action scenes would get as much attention as any other blockbuster and then would be forgotten and here another one jj and company thinks this movie will bring in new fan base so he can dispose of the old one here some news for him it wo not for new fans this is as important as transformers i predict much smaller audience for sequel since many trekkie will boycott it and new fans will forget about it go to transformers vi or something i gave it # i would give it ### if i could ,3
359,EN,-583022231,the good casting at worst ok at best excellent special effects a lot of great work is used simply as background as it should be there were a lot of nice touches going from the loud emergency inside a craft to the silence of space relationships between characters this is where this film really does nail it the prologue very effecting although i think roddenberry would have hated it direction i liked the way the camera was continually taken off at odd angles generally the camera was used very dynamically historic nods lots are used without being too distracting the bad the plot it really does not work the more you think about it the more holes you can punch in it worth watching but concentrate on the characterisation and park your brain at the door m,7

363,EN,912747377,seriously mesmerizing fantastic genius no i was pretty excited about this film after all the hype and i feel massively let down the plot was overly drawn out and repetitive and there was an over reliance on action with massive portions of the plot being taken up by filler scenes of silly shoot outs and car chases christopher nolan has given this film a superficial sheen of meaningfulness with the admittedly astounding visuals covering for a plot so full of holes it almost falling apart why are dom and mal shown as having grown old and grey together in limbo when they are also shown laying their head on train lines to escape limbo as ## somethings why does the incessant music come to dominate the film making every scene feel climactic which is actually detrimental to the final climax in a similar manner to the way in which the wachowski brothers took the brilliant writings of baudrillard and completely mangled them beyond all meaning in the matrix nolan has taken a great idea and turned it into a teenage boy shoot em up action fantasy people might watch it and think wow that really deep no it not it has the appearance of being deep and meaningful when in fact it just a shallow action film i am sure people will read this review and think she just does not get it the problem is that i do it get unfortunately there just not a lot to get ,2
364,EN,912747377,i have not got the faintest idea of what this is about perhaps something about controlling other people dreams to get what you want in this case it once again the evil corporation which wants to rule the world ok great in fact there is no plot or five running at the same time you decide you can see paris upside down if you are interested but really the time when we got impressed by computer tricks is since long over together with all the quasi intellectualism in the dialog this is very hard to stand and not even entertaining something is wrong when you are bored already after two minutes and then there are more than ### minutes to go a serious warning about this ,3
365,EN,912747377,really disappointing with a predictable ending far too long lacked intelligence and little real depth derivative of ## movie dreamscape and later the matrix among others too much ego nolan nice technical effects but nothing new a poor script however the acting was good they managed to keep a straight face throughout as a connoisseur of sci fi movies in general it really did not hit the mark probably because it wanted to be a mainstream film could have done with at least ## minutes cutting the final third was actually boring and the endless action sequences just became a blur do not believe the hype this is yet another summer blockbuster that fails to hit the mark although obviously better than prince of persia airbender and the really garbage stuff ,4
366,EN,912747377,what could have been the next the matrix turned into a james bond movie honestly the idea behind the movie is great explaining it is what makes this movie so unique the idea of inception is that you can either be dreaming or in real world and the fact they could turn this idea into a movie is brilliant great actors great production great soundtrack but bad story telling and depth in the end you feel like something is missing the film just adds to much unnecessary action instead of just exploring the idea of dream the characters are awful not depth and make questionable hard decisions when they could simplify everything plot is not logical at all and do not tell me it the idea of the movie because it is not it just that the narration is bad but a # because the movie gives a great feeling as a whole the soundtrack and production again are awesome i am so sad a potential great movie is just a ninja kung fu style way to explore a great idea ,7
367,EN,912747377,ok this is surely not the third greatest movie ever as the statistics on here indicate so far i am an avid movie buff who watches every detail of a movie like a rabbit in heat watches female rabbits it is a good movie and i will be thinking about it for a while but not as long as i thought about memento christopher nolen is a genius of some kind i admit anyone who can write like he does certainly is i do some writing myself and i am envious i cannot point out any specific flaws in the movie other than the obvious some of the concepts just would not work in reality the acting was good and the story was intriguing as can be cgi i could care less about as it does not make a great movie i am leery of the voters on here as there seems to be no real reason they are voting for what they vote on come on the shawshank redemtion is picked as the best movie of all time that laughable i do recommend seeing this movie but if you are a movie buff for real i also recommend going back in time and seeing some well rated older moves from directors such as scorsese bergman coppola spielberg and aronofsky you will definitely see this is not the #rd best movie of all time there is too much emphasis put on votes from a younger crowd who simply like weird stuff as opposed to intelligent all around film making combined with excellent acting ,8
368,EN,912747377,this was the first movie in years that had strangers buzzing about what we all saw in the men room after it ended that leads me to conclude that the film while not short at around ### minutes was compelling enough that nobody took a break during the viewing there was a lot to talk about on the drive home and i see the imdb board is buzzing with speculation on what happened particularly the ending you could probably watch inception half a dozen times sussing out the fictional technology that was at its heart the hidden meanings in some of the dialog the multiple layers upon layers in which the plot took place my take was less concerned with the details i went into this viewing expecting an inspired film experience created by a modern master and i was not disappointed i found the cinematography on par with and no doubt inspired by hitchcock classics like north by northwest and vertigo it should win an oscar in that category the score was fantastic the actors were clearly enjoying themselves this was a summer hollywood blockbuster of the finest quality ,9

375,EN,1707142003,it seems most reviewers that reviewed this movie as bad were severely uninformed and had no prior knowledge to the director nicolas winding refn previous films not only that but they completely missed the point in short terrible reviewers now for my review of the film sublimely hypnotizing cinematography freezes the viewers eyes to the movie screen an experience like no other drive throws you into the world of a hollywood stunt driver that moonlights as a getaway driver only to have you thrown even deeper into his psyche and the relationship he fosters with a seemingly single mother an her little boy only to have you pulled out of the majesty and thrown into a nightmare when the woman ex con husband is released from prison the ex husband is not a bad person but he got involved with the wrong crowd seeing the husband get beaten the driver gets involved to protect the boy and his mother the movie goes through a very crazy transition as the driver takes on every evil in the movie just for the love of the mother and son see this movie because whether you like it or not is incredibly subjective that being said i absolutely loved it ,4
376,EN,276766581,beautifully written expertly acted directed well and perfectly designed this movie succeeds on all levels and not just as a high school movie but as one about human beings the clich d issues and scenarios that inevitably come with a high school film are handled with such humanity and honesty that they become authentic there are hilarious moments and heartbreaking ones and your emotions go on a roller coaster ride that is synonymous with high school itself instead of the usual cringe worthy sentimentality you feel something for the # dimensional characters simply because it is all so real during one of the best scenes the main character charlie says i feel infinite this movie is infinite because it can appeal to more than just high school students the core themes and conflicts are all humane that just happen to be set in a high school ,10
377,EN,1385892728,i just watched this series over the holidays as any fan would and boy did it hit the spot john mclane is synonymous with ##s action what a blast out of the original three die hard two is probably the weakest link the most recent die hard it probably the worst of the franchise everyone agrees that the first one is the best but i had the most fun watching the third and the fourth one if they were to do a prequel i would really like to see them cast jgl as a young bruce willis again it would be too good you all know you liked it in looper ,9
378,EN,977814393,i am a huge fan of the first three movies and actually wished they were longer but turning the hobbit into three movies researching other tolkien works for filler placing lotr characters in a story when they were never there before and just making up new characters so jackson could stretch one story into three for me it ruined the purity of a wonderful story peter jackson got to show off his special effect skills in super extension but it left me feeling like this was nothing more that a betrayal of j r r tolkien story i wish there was more to this movie than cgi on steroids it was nice seeing evangeline lilly on the big screen all the actors are wonderful in this brand new story but it not the hobbit i am thinking that jackson left the source behind in order to make more money out of the franchise i hope someday they make one movie out of these three but i will definitely not be seeing the third ,1

380,EN,2041022337,i love this movie so much i am not going to add a very long detail of why i do i just wanted to say that everyone found it hilarious that at the end when rose says i will never let go jack then she lets go of his hand it not his hand that she meant he had made her promise to never let go of the promise to live her life to the fullest and be all she could be etc that what she never let go and it proves that at the end when you see all of the photos of her life and the scene at the end when she sees everyone who died in the grand staircase and she kisses jack is so touching even if i turn on the movie to only that part it makes me cry it the small touches too that make it good like the irish mom telling her kids one last story so that they die quietly is the sweetest thing ,9

382,EN,-1557021310,i have seen all of these movies and must say it was a great set to watch the reason that is the start of my review here is because when i was deciding to undergo the trilogy i was unsure if it was going to be worth it not everyone can sit through the subtitled movies for one reason or another but i was glued to the screen and was able to keep plenty of focus on the quality film i do not want to spoil so i will just say each movie is like a bourne movie but these show right where the other left off and i believe you could watch one without all three but i would not choose that route carve out some time and watch great foreign films each is over # hours so it might take a few days but well worth it cheers to swedish film ,8
383,EN,59956099,the coen brothers have done very well and accomplished a movie that completely shocked me slight spoiler alert the movie is based on the odyssey and because it follows it so much i would highly recommend rereading it or at least look at the cliff notes the thing is if you know the odyssey you will get a lot of the jokes that are thrown in there i saw one comment on here by another user who did not like the movie and thought that the scene spoiler spoiler where the guy slaughters several cows was excessive and that the coen brothers were just trying to be shocking i was laughing a lot because i understood the connection in the scene to the book major major spoiler connection is that in the odyssey they kill very sacred cows of apollo and those men are struck with lightning in the movie the character who kills the cows is electrocuted in the chair absolutely brilliant there are tons of odyssey jokes here so much so that if you do not read it before watching at least read it afterwards you simply cannot do the movie total justice without seeing how genius the coens are oh and you will be singing to yourself the type of music you thought you hated before this movie highly recommended this is up there on my favorites list a list that is hard to make well not that hard but there only about ## titles on it those who do not see this movie are men in constant sor row razor,8
384,EN,59956099,forget about the odyssey think preston sturges the coens like to take a genre and make a new movie in that vein miller crossing is a gangster movie blood simple is film noir hudsucker proxy is the wisecracking newshen comedy yeah ok the main character who looks a lot like clark gable is trying to get home in a homeric way facing obstacles and fighting monsters so he can return to his wife but that just the broadbrush outline of the plot the reference to homer might even be sort of a joke people know that a coen movie is a tribute to some style of film so maybe they deliberately put based on homer odyssey in the opening credits you might be looking for homer but what you will get is sturges it a ####s or ##s kind of comedy two things impressed me at the start of the movie there that scene with the three convicts chained together falling out of the freight train you have seen it in the trailers or the tv ads immediately after that they meet a blind man who predicts their future it a funny scene followed by a framing scene the wise old man and a blind one at that is an old story telling technique like something from joseph campbell explanations of the journey of the hero or maybe something from the odyssey here and there other myths or folklore pop in a guitar player at the crossroads and a gubernatorial candidate whose theme song is you are my sunshine the coens are creating a myth and they are borrowing liberally from myths both ancient and modern here what i want from a movie to transport me to a different world and to surprise me i could go through the movie and list the parts that transported me the baptism scene was like watching mystical musical ghosts and i love the scene where the three convicts plus the guitarist play their song in a period of about five or ten minutes several plot lines were wrapped up bam bam bam bam but i wo not spoil the plot for anyone who might be reading this plus there lots of humor it a very funny movie one thing bothered me the ku klux klan part yeah i know the kkk are the bad guys but they are just so obviously bad it like putting nazis in a cartoonish movie like indiana jones the minor character who decided to be anti kkk was basically a jerk however maybe that part of myth making you insert a character like the devil the audience will automatically hate overall it a huge thumbs up not as good as miller crossing or fargo but definitely worth seeing the coen brothers have made another great movie toddh,9

386,EN,59956099,oh brother where art thou is a very strange film i wonder if i am just not the right kind of person to watch and enjoy this i know lots of viewers like this movie but i absolutely hate it i think george clooney is a very talented actor and i usually like him both on the big screen and in real life but he just really annoyed me here his acting seems way too over the top funny and it all just too obvious what i mean by that is that i do not really like it when actors deliver comedic lines so obviously that it not funny i prefer more dry witty type humor but it not just the way the actors say the lines it also the writing it too over the top and obvious when comedic dialogue is written in that way in my opinion they lose their appeal and amusement factor it drains the funny reaction out that the audience is supposed to experience and the issue is that it not like this movie drops lines like that it all the time i could forgive a few moments like that but not all throughout the whole thing so really since the comedy did not work for me and actors that i normally like were held captive to this bad writing the whole thing just does not work also i really hate bluegrass music so whenever that would occur it would just make it that much worse # ## ,1

392,EN,-175422583,the shawshank redemption is one of the best movies i have ever seen when i was younger i would always see this movie playing on various channels and always wondered why what made this movie so special well the answer is pretty much everything in this movie is special from the performances of tim robbins and morgan freeman whose characters are really fleshed out in subtle ways to the overall themes that have made the movie so watchable ever since it was first released there is a reason this movie is still being played on channels to this day if you have not seen this movie than go watch it immediately you wont regret it ,10
393,EN,-175422583,there nothing in life more meaningful than endlessly talking about movies and there no discussion as entertaining as fighting over which was the best year for films i always go for #### mainly because it produced three movies that are truly unique and show up in every best of list you can imagine i mean it pretty tough to find a person that does not have either forrest gump pulp fiction or the shawshank redemption in their personal top ten while the first two movies still have a considerable group of opponents to some people forrest gump is too much of a tearjerker while pulp fiction apparently glorifies violence too much the shawshank redemption is one of those movies nobody can really dislike it a movie that goes beyond matters of taste the story writing and acting are so undeniably good that it tough to come up with a counterargument writer director frank darabont is also a fantastic dialogue writer particularly when it comes to bit characters you can also see this in the somewhat inferior the green mile characters who only have one or two lines say the perfect line on the perfect moment the amazing performances by tim robbins and morgan freeman do the rest the best movie ever made it definitely up there ,10

396,EN,-175422583,if you did not like the shawshank redemption then you do not understand the concept of the film shawshank is the epitome of good film making a fresh interesting verisimilar detailed story coupled with acting that makes tim robbins stand out in my mind as andy dufresne himself the imagery is beautiful the story has few if any holes and morgan freeman plays the character of red the film narrator exceedingly well to those who find it unnatural that a murderer has matured into a wise thoughtful man during a long tenure in prison i suggest that there is no more logical place for such a transformation red has had ## years upon andy arrival to think about the crimes of his youth and has grown as a result in short shawshank is a movie for people who like good stories it will make you laugh it might make you cry and in the end you will simply feel good about life itself ,10

400,EN,-1086569320,after watching the newest nolan film the dark knight rises a real let down i had to remind myself how good of a director mr christopher nolan is i watched for the #th time the prestige contrary to following and memento you do not know until the end that there is something more than what you see until the end and then you watch it again and notice all the clues it one of these plots which seems so simple but as in magic tricks nothing is what it seems it a great screen play of christopher priest novel the cast is incredible and christian bale needs to be congratulated for his versatility mr nolan did it again and the illusion is great i was wondering how he could out do following and memento and he pulled one over my eyes again no i wo not tell you the plot because other people already did that and if i was to tell you more i would be spoiling the movie for you let just say that i would have hated to have missed watching such a great movie please enjoy it and know that you wo not be disappointed in fact you will remember the prestige for quite a while ,10
401,EN,-1086569320,let face it there are not many good writers for cinema yet the bar has gotten higher while certain narrative structures have become more acceptable nolan has earned a place as one of the best without a spanish surname it seems he starts with a notion of multiple parallelisms in narrative then fleshes them out using some of the techniques common in or best literature but always envisioned first cinematically the five parallelisms here are warring magicians mirrored by the warring real life magicians tesla and edison the realities of life and pretended or performed life with the common fold of the play we see and the performance s they make multiple existence of beings different slices of time as the narrative is unrolled backwards and forwards in bits the way the stories are recounted in two overlapping diaries each a lure pay particular attention to this and the fairly literate references starting with van helsing and covering at least a few shakespearean phrases its therefore # times more clever engaging and rewarding than the illusionist itself a competent oneway fold spend some time with this that batman thing went over well with some folks i know but it was a waste of talent this is where the man belongs welcome home chris stay away from comics the acting is irrelevant good thing ted evaluation # of # worth watching ,5
402,EN,-1086569320,two magicians angier and borden become arch enemies following the accidental death of angier wife during a magic trick the conflict between them escalates as they desperately seek to create the perfect human transportation trick i found it profoundly difficult to follow the plot for a good first half of the prestige and for good reason i believe two people both dressed in black for the most part of the film both engaged in magic tricks both with a similar build composed the soul of the story yet it was hard for me to tell both of them apart or indeed identify them as the main characters when they appear in fact seeing the movie poster again after watching the movie i realised that the two faces on the poster does seem like the same person to add to the difficulty of telling the characters apart both main characters disguised themselves at some parts of the film and it happens that understanding who is who at these portions is crucial to an understanding of the plot in addition cuts that messed up the chronology could also have been found throughout the film some were crucial for an effective and impactful climax and resolution others especially the relentless flashbacks to the prison scene only serves to show off the director knowledge of the flashback as a story telling device and ultimately leaves the viewer very confused after two hours of intricate building up of the conflict the story reveals with cunning and wit how certain elements of the plot were even possible at the same time it raises germane and thought provoking issues challenging the viewer original perception of certain things in the story what makes the concluding revelation all the more keen was how it could have been guessed prior to the revealing itself clues like the duplicated cats and hats and key elements like the revolver and the water tank were already known to the viewer and all it took was a missing link to conceal the actual dynamics of the plot this allowed the revelation to be done elegantly and without being a forced reconciliation of the plot an amazingly well thought out film lost in imperfect retelling that my feel on the prestige ,6

404,EN,1467284882,when i started to write this short review on the film the last of the mohicans #### my utter amazement left me stupefied in front of an avalanche of information that was available on the background novel and its author james fenimore cooper this is good and bad simultaneously if someone in their teens try to understand the plot he will soon become too shy in his endeavor the leatherstocking tales as a series of novels each featuring the main hero natty bumppo and his adventures in american wild west have long time became a historical legacy the five novels are themselves based on real events reflecting episodes from life of the author james f cooper as frontiersman and navigator on the area of great lakes ontario and erie so the lush youngster should beware before making hurried conclusions now on some personal commentaries the last of the mohicans a novel was written in #### and tells a narrative from #### the seven years war between france and great britain battled for control of north america this war led ultimately to the american war of independence #### #### since the british settlers were not pressed southward anymore by the french and their indian allies in continental europe the french defeat led to outbreak of the french revolutionary wars in #### so one can realize now the immense impact of this local indian drama from ##th century on the global ebb of historical events no offence for titular author but cooper himself was a poor historian and could not grasp in his imaginative mind the long term consequences of what was going on around him the french and indian wars the american war of independence etc his main source of information was the local antiquarian society which was in itself an achievement consider for instance the contribution of people like lewis morgan and his anthropological research on the iroquois ancient society the mohawks and five nations as in the movie and the novel they fought against their adversaries the hurons from algonquin tribes of canada and intermittently with the white settlers that in due course sacked them to a vanishing race as good as the novel has been though sometimes packed with slow action and much verbosity the film directed by michael mann appears to me even better several are the reasons and in first place the simplified plot the credits for the screen adaptation belong to several people but they did an excellent job get here the differences with the novel which i consider essential # only the leading male characters remain unchanged natty bumppo or hawkeye chingachgook the big snake uncas the last of mohicans and magua the huron # colonel munro family does not die in the book except cora in the film cora remains alive while the colonel is killed by magua and later he also kills alice and uncas magua is slain finally by chingachgook # duncan heyward a british army major is presented as traitor and dies on fire stake david gamut a psalmodist is not existent in the film thank you ,10

414,EN,1184626589, matrix was definitely thought provoking i have been a hard core science fiction fan since i was in my early teens and am always glad to see a film which draws on some of the more complex ideas of the written genre as opposed to stereotypical space operas i did find a few faults with the underlying rationale for the ai exploitation of the human race however supposedly the machines had been almost entirely reliant on solar power which i found a dubious premise to begin with and then we are told that the perpetual smog has blocked out that power source necessitating using people as living electrical generators batteries the problem with that idea is that a human being and indeed any form of biological life requires energy input and where are all those calories coming from there was mention of recycling the dead people and feeding them to the live ones but even assuming ### energy recapture efficiency a practical impossibility no more can be gotten out of the people than is being put in and the machines use of that power represents an external drain on the biological system also i am afraid it absurd to postulate as the movie did that earth interior could cool significantly over the course of a couple of hundred years in the absence of sunlight it would probably take closer to a couple of billion years after all it almost as hot down below nowadays as it was a couple of billion years ago and the slow rate of heat loss by radiation into space has had a lot more to do with that than the influx of sunlight these flaws did not ruin the movie for me because i could think of at least one better reason for the machines to be exploiting the human race in an even more horrific fashion for instance the human brain is a much better computer in some ways than anything we are ever likely to build and i can see how a new breed of artificial intelligences might want to use that processing power for its own purposes and since very little of our brain capacity is directly involved in conscious thought i can see how the ais might be content to use only the unconscious parts or possibly every conscious effort by a human in the virtual world could actually be a processing activity for the benefit of the machines in a disguised symbolic form thus rather than providing us with a virtual reality merely to keep us biologically functional the vr could be part of the exploitation itself for whatever purpose it might be done the images of people being raised from birth obliviously socketed in endless hardware arrays will be with me for a long time of all the ideas presented in the movie the one i found most intriguing in an intellectual sense was that even if we could be presented with a perfect utopian virtual reality our brains would reject it because the element of struggle against adversity would be missing and i wonder how at the end the movie hero could ever be sure that all his trials and seeming successes within the virtual world and even the supposedly real external world had not merely taken place in an even larger virtual reality how could he ever know that his real body was not still plugged in somewhere for that matter how can any of us ever know that ours are not descartes who mused several hundred years ago about the dilemma of a person trapped by an evil genius in an imaginary world indistinguishable from a real one would have appreciated matrix i am sure ,8

416,EN,1184626589,i had first seen the previews of the matrix in the theatres and i have to admit they intrigued me because of the stunning effects however i was not going to spend ticket money on a film with keanu reeves then some friends of mine who i respect told me that it was actually worth the money and was a really good movie with this in mind i went to see the movie and immediately noticed the directors and writers their brothers were smart to keep keanu dialogue to a minimum i also was even more stunned by the special effects the lighting was very reminiscent of the crow the first and dark city both movies noted for their effects laurence fishburne gives an excellent performance and the casting was done well however keanu reeves as the protagonist actually was a pretty good choice because he plays a very good dark hero though i would have loved to see brandon lee play the main part the matrix was described to me as reminiscent of plato allegory of the cave and if anyone has read this cannon of philosophy it becomes clear that the movie is almost a direct modernization however it seems that the movie could have easily been ## ## minutes longer about half the movie takes place within the matrix and the other half in the real world but the movie fails to add any depth to either of these two worlds some more time spent on analyzing how keanu reeve character interacted within the matrix would have been very helpful and interesting instead the movie begins with him already feeling something is wrong with the world around him but shows not a single reason why this would be true i would like to think the writer did this to minimize keanu dialogue and role in the movie added to the thin development was the corny fight scenes the actual strikes and blows were very well choreographed but there were some very ridiculous posing which made most of them laughable if that was the goal of the fight scenes which i do not think it was then i cannot understand why they were done that way the entire theatre could not help but snicker seeing keanu do martial arts pose seemingly for no reason whatsoever to sum up i think the movie bought up some very interesting questions about reality and our perception of it however the two very interesting worlds that were created were not developed enough to satisfy my interest in either i came to the site and was appalled to see it ranked ## on the top ### list because of these shortcomings i gave it a # out of ## and would recommend it to a friend as an entertaining action flick that would not blow them away ,9

423,EN,-967019617,first reviewed on broth of blogs on word press ok lets start with the good the special effects were spectacular i am just another one who feels it was kaleidoscope y inception y but really they looked great but was there anything else cumberbatch as dr strange was good but not as great as downey as tony stark like most people are comparing i mean stark was so much more defined i did not even see why people are saying there are comparisons there were like # scenes where strange is shown to be an egotist and a brazenly rude genius i did not really care he lost his hands but i did care when stark was being held hostage because they developed the character there you see with strange they just fast forwarded without showing anything i did not really care for the whole mysticism and magic i mean i know and have read about chakras and energy and what one can do with practices like pranic healing and reiki the whole kamar taj nonsense just felt so superficial fake even you send strange up to everest and he learns magic because he cannot take the cold come on folks i really like the chemistry between stark and potts because again they gave it time to develop we do see some history here with strange and his ex love interest christine palmer but i did not feel any emotions when he insults her because that is what he has always done and says sorry when he realizes that he has been a dick all the while there was just too much going on with the plot too instead of the film makers taking time to develop the characters and just sticking to one world disaster waiting to happen they just zipped past the jerk turned superhero saves the world bit you see some of the other superheros are more common i mean most people would know the stories of superman or iron man or avengers but doctor strange they needed more of a back story not exposition of where there was just too much in the movie and what was tilda swinton doing in the movie they could have at least taken an asian as the ancient one do not even get me started on chiwetel ejiofor and his role in the movie he just looked gave up too easily being the master and all i could just go on and on about it but i will stop folks i do not have anything against the actors i think they did what they were asked to and they did it to the best of their abilities i blame the greedy studios trying to make another superhero movie just to fit the miu this could have been great memorable even if they had just given it time i think the only memorable thing in the movie was benedict wong as wong lol he was funny ,6

433,EN,1134267303,gotta start out by confessing that i only watched this movie as tarantino had some involvement in directing this movie now we got that declaration out of the way i must say this a great concept stunning visuals fabulous dark storyline set in a cartoon storyboard style shooting style hints of pulp fiction chop change scene cuts are prevalent but not to the same degree as the original master the beauty of this film for me is big quintons most admired asset in movie making developing character personalities how he pulls you into the world of each character and entices you to live a little in there shoes makes you empathize with each character in this flick a few twist and turns but a well thought out storyline willis rourke and alba are amazing i have watched it # times so far and have just purchased the blueray hey ho ,9
434,EN,1134267303,imagine if alfred hitchcock made a film noir in the nineteen forties with access to the same movie making technology that we have today then imagine that quentin tarantino co directed what you have imagined is sin city the new movie directed by robert rodriguez and frank miller from miller comic books the movie is in a way an astonishment because rodriguez has given us no prior evidence that he is capable of directing anything better than standard stylish action shlock oh man is he ever the film takes place in basin sin city a gotham new york hybrid that probably jumped straight out of frank miller nightmares when the sky is not grey it is red it is always raining and the population all seems to follow only one convention they have a considerable amount of dirty laundry it is as if rodriguez reached into the maltese falcon grabbed the city and threw it into a vat of gatorade which is a compliment of course after a short scene at the beginning which plays like a teaser hinting at sin city nature we are launched into three short stories all intersecting briefly in one place at a cheap strip joint outside the city we start with marv mickey rourke a massive rough sadist whose mug looks like a cross between mr incredible and a brick we do not know much about his past but we know it dirty and that he would probably deserve a lethal injection over a good woman but he gets a good woman which seems like a miracle to him and they spend a night together possibly the best night of his life when he wakes up she dead he wants to find out why who how and how to kill those guilty he says his quest is worth dying for worth killing for worth going to hell for then we take a leap into dwight world dwight clive owen is running from the law and has just hooked up with shellie brittany murphy the girl who loved him all her life but shellie ex boyfriend jackie boy benicio del toro wo not have it and he barges into their apartment with some heavies after a brief quibble jackie boy makes his exit violently drunk dwight suspects he on his way to old town to inflict hell on the prostitutes who act as law there the prostitutes who saved dwight life his friends he races off to help them and last but not least is the story of det john hartigan bruce willis one of the rare hero cops of sin city he saves a little girl from junior a pedophile nick stahl but junior has an important dad and hartigan goes to prison for nearly a decade framed for the crime when he gets out he races to find nancy callahan jessica alba the little girl who now all grown up and still targeted by junior but junior gone through some disturbing changes since his last bout with hartigan the many characters are wide ranging archetypes heroes owen willis anti heroes rourke villains rutger hauer michael clarke duncan psychos stahl del toro elijah wood good girls alba murphy carla gugino considerably more interesting bad girls rosario dawson devoan aoki and some mysterious figures josh hartnett most of the actors are perfectly cast some of them deliver performances worth remembering particularly rourke owen willis and del toro they are great at taking these characters and becoming them while still maintaining their star presence bruce willis reminds us of bruce willis but we remember him as john hartigan del toro wood and stahl are the only actors who have been cast against type the style of the film is what connects the three stories as well as the strip joint and similar themes about camaraderie love hate torture and redemption the movie is like a comic book as we have all said but you can only understand it if you have seen it then you will agree it feels like it was inked rodriguez will be remembered for this movie and this movie will be remembered because of frank miller genius and imagination it bloody yeah and it got quite a bit of nudity but you cannot imagine the movie without it i should hope no one would complain because what do they expect seeing a movie guest directed by tarantino the man himself tarantino scene is one of the best and strangest of the movie it involves clive owen benicio del toro a car some flashing lights and a pez dispenser i do not know if the movie will survive like pulp fiction has but i hope it does because it almost as good at combining pop culture references homages action harsh violence and deep character insights into one even narrative the movie is a joy a dark neo noir violent sometimes disgusting joy # ## ,10

441,EN,1938835273,tim burton directed this batman movie after batman had been turned into nothing more than a cartoonish comic book character due to the old batman tv series rather than as the complex comic book character he really is burton focused on the dark images connected with the character and the expository background that went into making bruce wayne batman his film batman succeeds in bringing this left for dead character popular again for the initial reasons he was popular does the film succeed on every level no way but it does have a lot going for it burton always brings humour to all his films and batman and batman returns are no exceptions these moments of humour tend to break the mood and atmosphere of each of these films from being truly dark a problem corrected rightly i believe in the newer batman begins but in these films the humor works much of the time and i cannot imagine anyone else playing the joker as well as jack nicholson who let face it makes much of this film work it is nicholson eerie erratic comical portrayal of a man descending into insanity that carries much of this film with his high energy performance and his endless stream of one liners many that work very well add that to burton dark tendencies in lighting scenes and gothic settings and his wicked sense of humor along with a quality cast of performers like billy dee williams jack palance pat hingle and the lovely kim basinger and you have the makings of a highly entertaining film michael keaton is an adequate batman like him much better than anyone else that played him afterward except christian bale keaton plays him conservatively wisely burton also is one to bring back the heroes of his cinematic past he gives michael gough a chance to show millions i always knew how good he was who he is and how good an actor he is in a role as alfred which would bring much deserved celebrity to gough i know there is a lot of discussion wanting to say one batman is better than another and i do believe the newer one comes closer to embracing the true spirit of the comics but i like both films for different things neither is perfect and both are very entertaining ,7
442,EN,498115513,this film was captivating and well made the acting was exquisite but the overall message in the film was quite disappointing the story is filled with characters who test the boundaries of morality and never seem to find any value in their own lives those who do find a reason to live actually find nothing but faith in mysticism marijuana and the afterlife there are many themes in this film but the one that insulted me the most was the constant jabbing at capitalism corporations are evil materialism is for the soul less greed leads to the decay of morals the filmmakers have surely read the bible their world is just as sinful and hopeless as the one which christians presume to live in and their only salvation is in life after death i do not wish to trash this film for it was actually very entertaining but in the end quite disappointing i just wanted to remind all of you out there that there is no such thing as original sin and that money is not the root of all evil it is the root of the pampered lives that all of us americans enjoy however if you enjoy movies which try to make you feel guilty and hopeless then american beauty is for you i however would prefer to see movies which make me proud to be a hard working human being who finds happiness in creativity and industry not in god and marijuana ,8

450,EN,-1593882209,the best music i have ever enjoyed in a hollywood movie nusrat fateh ali khan had proved his legendary talent in this movie as from the start one who is watching movie will b lost in nusrat voice all credit goes to mr tim robbins for choosing eddle vedder and nursrat fateh ali khan for its music i think the music of this movie had play a key role for its success because the chemistry of susan acting and nusrat music is mind blowing and one more thing you cannot forget sean penn he had proved his talent in this movie screen play and direction is very good making plot of the movie strong lenght of the movie is not too long so prevented the movie from being sketchy and jumbled in the end again hats off for nusrat fateh ali khan ,8
451,EN,-1819662859,why do i get the feeling as if most critics have missed the point of this movie a lot of them have said blow fails to be the drug epic that it was intended to be but a movie based on someone life can be nothing more or less than what the life was this movie most likely was not a drug epic because no matter how the story was told it probably would have fallen short of movie goers expectations the trailer certainly portrays it as a drug epic but it really is nothing more than the story of a very heartbreaking life if johnny depp fans or drug movie fans or just movie goers in general go to the theater for entertainment they are sometimes inevitably disappointed on such an occasion some people fail wallowing in their disappointment to catch on to the real point of such a movie sometimes reality is not as glamorous as the movies and this movie does a lot more telling of truths than glamorizing which affords it a lot more credit than it has received the main character by the name of george jung seemed to have taken part in the entire drug market as if it were business as usual he came off as if he was never interested in his own rise to the top and the top was so obscured that it could be argued he never got there without an extensive leap into studies of the man no one can really say whether depp performance was spot on or fell short but he certainly had no problem sympathizing with and conveying the emotions that no doubt must have surfaced in jung life and after all is not that what acting is all about if anyone were to say that depp fell short in this movie it would only be feasible to assume that it is harder for people to take him seriously as an actor because he is so easy on the eyes it is obvious that this movie was intended for a man with an iota of homeliness but at the end of the film they gave depp wrinkles and a gut and he still looked hot none the less such things that cannot be helped must be overlooked and i would move to say that johnny depp performance was no less than brilliant if the movie had one significant criminal flaw it was in portraying jung as the protagonist who wants to do nothing more than love his daughter this is done in narrative by the character himself so we must remember that his reality is slightly askew to the viewers the words he tells us are not for us to believe but simply to tell the story from his point of view he still leaves us with our own decisions to make toward him at the end the movie was not wildly funny or wildly entertaining but sometimes a movie can still be brilliant without those things the way to measure this movie before jumping to conclusions is to take a pen and draw a line between the characters and the actors it is all but impossible to do in this movie and that is why it deserves a second look ,9
452,EN,-797216831,the best film of #### the first thing is that this is a peter weir film not a jim carrey film though he was great in a breakout role and should have been nominated for the oscar this film is very hitchkockian the feel is one of menace under a thin veil of normalcy this is added to by the production design and cinematography the acting is great ed harris gives great support to carrye as the sinister father figure christof the script is so subtle it probably feels more clever than it is it is ultimately a very moving modern fable about a man trying to be his own person when the world is trying to manipulate him into being what they want in case i do not see ya good afternoon good evening and good night ,9
453,EN,-591439420,hitchcock topped himself in #### basically inspiring all modern horror pictures with psycho a new kind of fright flick never seen before # years later he made a foray into the supernatural with the birds if you have not seen the film and do not think a bunch of gulls and sparrows can hold you in suspense think again the great thing about a hitchcock movie is that you always know you are about to enter a world where all is not right this world usually involves an innocent man wrongly accused eventually on the run the world of the birds has none of this nature has run amok and the characters paper thin as they are will go through a truly terrifying ordeal one of the most innovative aspects here is a lack of any musical score of any kind hitch long time partner bernard herrman is listed as sound consultant and i am sure he had something to do with the ominous sounds of the various birds as their building wrath is indicated by their squawks the attack scenes are a bit dated but considering the technology of the day was pre historic compared to the computer generated effects of today they come across chillingly some birds were props others hand drawn even others real the film surprisingly benefits from a lack of music heightening the suspense tippi hedren is the icy blonde and a standard of hitch movies the jealous or overbearing mother is played by jessica tandy in an awkwardly distant role performances aside hitch does something he wished not to do in psycho the bloody attacks are in bright technicolor and one scene depicting a victim of the birds is quite shocking hitch was afraid of showing the bloody carnage of the hower scene in color leaving it to the viewer imagination it works here showing the blood red evil happening in this everyday small town if you are claustrophobic i would avoid the birds like janet leigh in the psycho shower scene tippi hedren is caught in a phone booth in one of many tight situations shot from overhead otherwise let sir alfred play you like a piano like he so often has before ,9
454,EN,-591439420,the birds by alfred hitchcock is one of the worst movies i have ever seen to start of the movie is not realistic because the setting follows the story of two people and when the girl basically stalks him when he invites her to his little sisters birthday party they get attacked by birds i know even though this movie is old the graphics are so bad you will say to yourself yep thats a green screen and it takes away from the horror the actors themselves do a terrible job acting they do not even make the performance convincing out of all the movie was so bad and i do not recommend anyone go see this movie in the end i wish i could have ended up like the farmer in the beginning of the movie with no eyes at the mercy of the birds,1
455,EN,-164439097,after a plethora of marvel movies out this year gotg is another hit for the marvel universe now mind you this is coming from a completely unbiased viewer as i had absolutely no idea what gotg was or about until i saw the film i went in with absolutely no presumptions or expectations of how the movie would compare to the actual comics cartoon and i was utterly entertained so far i am choosing this as a front runner for winning best visual effects for this years oscars yes that how good the graphics are throughout the film the movie has more computer generated reality than actual people or places and every bit of it is done spectacularly along with the intense visuals gotg has its share of well timed humor just enough most action superhero flicks looking for comedic relief tend to go overboard a subtle romantic angle and exciting action sequences the most surprising of the cast was would ave bautista he plays would rax the destroyer believe me i had my doubts as will most people did a phenomenal job who i think will shock everyone at how well he plays the character groot and rocket were perfectly made and voiced probably the most entertaining lovable of the ensemble while in my opinion the cast and the visuals were the strongest points of the film the only let down was the story which was very clich d a menacing villain and the almost unstoppable hero s with the latter coming out on top like always still remains to be the perfect formula regardless this is a must see film p s i am groot ,8

462,EN,1854737865,this film seems to have received incredible high praise and is currently listed in the top### of this website i hate to fly in the face of such adoration but this film left me completely indifferent and rather irritated if not highly annoyed sure there are a few nice setpieces but it all set against a hack handed background rendering them only a mild distraction from the otherwise continuous amazement at the film triteness and mindboggling illogical plotpoints the film is poorly structured and almost entirely if not completely un engaging with the most lame and sappy ending i have ever seen to a film this film is supposed to be full of big ideas on britain dystopian future and the reactions of the public to an infertility plagued society angry youth throwing rocks at trains the rails to auschwitz have been reopened and are deporting the fugees not the band back to where they came from hell and even the spectrum of light is somehow compromised with this kind of background you would expect the movie to actually focus on any of it something which this movie is acclaimed for but apart from the main characters being in a bad mood for ## brief minutes there is surprisingly little this movie reflects on the exposition on these theme was simply replaced by endless shots of people being deported nazi style the english countryside and mind numbing dialog that was doing little else than driving the weary plot onward the whole infertility and the world gone to hell themes could just as well have been left out entirely and it would not have made any difference to the actual storyline of two people on the run truly amazing that someone would spent enormous amounts of money on expensive filming equipment only to make the actual picture look like it was shot by my uncle fred who has parkinson who just got his handicam yesterday for christmas and is still working his way through the manual which is written in chinese and which apparently only describes how to deprive the picture of colour in children of men subtlety was not allowed everything is as bad as bad comes and even good is apparently bad the sets look over the top sleazy our main characters are anything but likable a pasture of grazing cows has been replaced by a smouldering pile of meat and bones the rebels simply kill their leader over a dispute or kill policemen when they turn up at the wrong place at the wrong time the overemphasized way of portraying such a dull and drab doomsday landscape as was done in children of men surely would bother anyone who is not into cartoonistic film making but in stead likes some subtlety on any subject matter if indeed this is presented in a serious movie maybe i misunderstood but i believed that what this movie was meanwhile in the film the script is pretty awful caine certainly tries his utmost with it but his lines are one note and much too viewer informative only to result in a feeling of we get it already move on please owen is his usual wooden self and thus type casted perfectly in the role of theo faron a morose lower government official who could not give a fart about anything although i really liked his performance his character is screenplayed terribly and i could not give an equal fart about his fate in the movie next up a utterly forgettable cameo by julianne moore some b actors to play the bad guys lead by chiwetel ejiofor who since his performance in serenity for me lost all credibility as an actor and newcomer claire hope ashity as the black virgin mary who does little more than swear a lot which by modern standards is apparently good enough for a olid performance in the books of the critics frankly her performance would not even cut it on eastenders the story in children of men is practically non existent and covered not much more than an action packed chase from the old peril to the land of deliverance but this was done on purpose to not loose focus on the sublime messages it miserably failed to communicate because they forgot to include them as a result many of the scenes drag relentlessly while jarring opera music and a hate crime of a muzak cover version of ruby tuesday plundered that what was left of the viewer will to live indeed it really all that bleak and pointless but intentionally so the end result of all this is an aesthetic crime against the art loving moviegoer or the one with more than # brain cells to rub together the end result is also one that is critically acclaimed by nothing less than the entire society of professional movie critics minus one or two who probably did not receive the letter which stated they would get a nice percentage of the movie revenues when their review would be kind seriously you would think all these glowing reviews and those on this website were written by people who had somehow managed to miss the entirety of western cinema the gourmet fare that is children of men is actually a night out at the mcdonald of film making where the second bite of your food is already spoiling the experience of the first let us all gather in prayer and hope that there wo not be a sequel unless the sequel was already made when they created hoot em up another highly creative movie in which mr owen is once again protecting a baby that people are trying to kill evy,1

and aliens these are films that also entertain but they force you to examine who we are and where we have come from and where we could possibly go is it possible that man will one day become so unbearable that some divine intervention will occur so that we are not the inferior species a film like this makes you think and wonder what if ## out #f ## this is one of the best films i have ever seen and it is one that i am going to get my kids to watch someday burton is fun and thought provoking this one is simply mind blowing and intellectually stimulating this is a must see for any generation ,10
472,EN,-1405213224,this film is simply superb it is so refreshing to watch a movie that is so entertaining and captivating without being filled with the usual high speed action flashing lights and violence that you would normally expect in a movie of this genre the brilliance of this movie lies in the performances of the characters it undoubtedly has one of the best casts in any movie ever made every word spoken every action every look by every character is immaculate in its intention the film also gives us what i believe is one of pacino best performances from start to finish he is utterly enthralling particularly in the famous attica scene the scene where he is speaking on the phone to leon and then his wife and of course the scene where he is creating his will to conclude i loved this film ,9

475,EN,-1720485409,firstly let me say i have been a life long spider man fan and love both of the recent movies but after seeing this i am finding it hard to decide which i prefer the bat or the spider i guess it will all depend on my mood as they both have significantly different atmospheres of course no movie is perfect and only # movie has ever scored a perfect ## but this came damn close great acting writing directing and a realism no other superhero movie could possibly match mind you batman is not a superhero in the true sense of the word as he does not actually have any super powers the whole origin was superb his training his gadgets his fears and torments they are all feasibly realistic and best of all no cheesy nipples on the costume i hope for the love of god that we will not be inflicted with a robin or batgirl in any of the sequels because that will spoil the mood in closing if you have not seen this movie yet do it ,9
476,EN,-1720485409, note over ### of my movie reviews are now available in my book cut to the chaise lounge or i cannot believe i swallowed the remote get it at amazon the idea here and it is an admirable one is to account for in a realistic way how the fictional character bruce wayne became batman the superhero why did he become a crime fighter how did he become so skilled so tough and so motivated how was he able to come up with such effective gadgetry including the super hi tech batmobile and why did he chose the bat as his motif from what i can tell it was screenwriter david s goyer who asked himself these questions and saw that answering them could be made into a kind of blockbuster prequel to the batman movie phenomenon but it was director christopher nolan who made it work nolan also directed the sensational memento #### a story about a man who is only able to remember what has happened during the last minute or two and has no memory of anything before that up to the time he suffered a head injury he has to write down where he parks his car so he can find it later and he keeps pictures with notes on people he sees regularly because he can never remember them or any interaction he has with them memento is a stunningly brilliant film that skyrocketed nolan to fame goyer wrote a number of screenplays before batman begins none of them of much importance i happened to have seen the film arcade #### for which he wrote the script a harmless undistinguished scifi for teens but nothing else of his nonetheless goyer is a natural for something like batman begins because he is a writer of comics who attended the usc film school and or was a collector of comics he cares about comics and comic book heroes and he knows enough about film to write a script that might work he and nolan share credit for the script the story begins in tibet where a young bruce wayne learns how to fight like a ninja and gains insights into himself and who he is there are flashbacks to his childhood in which he falls into a dry well and is terrified by the bats that fly out over his head as he lies trapped he sees his parents murdered in a holdup this motivates him to become a crime fighter the later part of the movie shows bruce wayne discovering a cave under the wayne mansion interacting with the loyal family butler alfred michael caine and getting help with his crime fighting inventions from tech and forensics expert lucius fox morgan freeman katie holmes plays bruce childhood friend who has become a prosecuting attorney fighting bravely against the crime and corruption that have become rampant in gotham city there are an number of nice touches and the visuals are really arresting the batmobile itself is fascinating to watch in action especial during one of the most spectacular chase scenes ever envisioned as batman directs the vehicle up a ramp to the top of a building and then leads the cops on a chase as the batmobile leaps from one building to another some of the early action is a bit beyond belief although the intent is realism most notably when bruce wayne manages to fight his way singlehandedly out of the ninja mountain training camp and has the strength in one arm to stop the fall of ninja leader henri ducard liam neeson and hold himself and ducard at the precipice of a cliff and then pull ducard up near the end of the film as batman shoots up from the ground on wires and glides and springs from rooftop to rooftop with the greatest of ease the action becomes clearly comic book like regardless this is without question the best superhero movie i have ever seen it is not only a commercial triumph for nolan and everybody connected with the picture but given the genre an artistic and creative one as well see this for christopher nolan who is quickly becoming one of hollywood most successful directors ,9

478,EN,-1720485409,cheers for an nice event very wisely done and very illustrative #d animation is brilliant #d animation is as good brilliant an outcome of achievement and perfection the whole story begins and continues as dramatic and equally unpredictable if there is anything that inspires it is the fact that there are a lot of changes of equipment and scenes there are of course a lot of similarities with the batman movies but as regards the everyday life anomalies and the quick solutions they needed it is an absolute miracle to have something like that in front of our eyes knowing that it does not exist yet knowing it is not real ### it is a brilliant peace of cinema children and i suggest you watch it ,10

483,EN,625460988,this film did an excellent job of portraying charlie chaplin other than overdramatizing younger lovers the film i felt was accurate back in the early part of the century ages of consent were much lower the film made it seem like chaplin was a pedophile but clearly it was a different world during a different time robert downey jr as usual was immersed in his role i do not believe any actor could have done a better job i certainly understand him winning an oscar for this portrayal the rest of the actors were excellent as well this film had fantastic direction and i would not expect anything different from richard attenborough you know it is an excellent film when you feel you are a part of that time period and locations comedy and drama were complimented very nicely in this film as an historical educational project i felt i was enlightened very much so about this time period that said i think the film also did a wonderful job of interlacing events such as wwi hitler and the depression without going overboard basically relating these historic events to the bio of chaplin this is definitely a must see film for any film buff ,8
484,EN,-1639893422,the mel gibson bandwagon of pain misery and torture rolls on with apocalypto a quite stunning two hour plus quasi exploitation film in a language close to all but dead springing surprises and taking you places few films that you have previously seen will have done what with his semi directorial input on #### production dogged payback and by comparison his oscar winning efforts for #### braveheart gibson has shifted from putting himself through wringers of strife sadism and oppression and decided to transpire it unto others but where does one go from jesus christ in #### the passion of the christ why to the ancient pre colonial south american cultures of the mayans of course in the nicest possible way film is bonkers a jungle set ancient civilisation depicting two and a half hour mean machine of chase adventure peril and aggressive plot twists forcing your complete and undivided attention as it goes to places you have already reassured yourself they will not dare tread anywhere near in the first place before going beyond them further still first and foremost i would disagree with those who criticise the film for being vacant or empty those who might pull the film up for coming across as too exploitative or violent for the sake of violence i always got the sense that this was a piece of cinema a piece of film making first and foremost something with a craft to it a series of deft poetic touches applied to a narrative that has before been told but in a setting rarely before depicted take the scene much nearer the end when a trap in the jungle has been sprung the little trigger item flies up into the air falls to the ground into some dirt with a muddy splash and all to a sort of balletic slow motion as some kind of chanting native to these parts of the world doubles up as the musical overture to the thing being set off impaling its prey and leaving the instigator there to admire their work there a sort of poetry to the whole thing a sense of grace and timing in the editing and use of sound something which elevates it a bit above what people a keen to dismiss it as the film follows rudy youngblood mayan tribesperson jaguar paw a young and handsome man who cuts a different figure to most others in his village with his leaner figure and unabashed attitude he has a wife and a child with another one on the way and is part of a small community of those whom descend from generations of mayan people always occupying this very specific jungle stretch it is jaguar and his fellow tribesmen who open the film with a dramatic hunting sequence wherein a wild animal falls afoul of their tried and tested techniques designed to gore and incapacitate prey thereafter they feast on their kill with an immediate effect devouring the vital organs and convincing the fall guy of the party to gorge on the animals testicles when he does so it tastes gross and ends up being the one part of it you do not want to eat but with everything else being shared around was he to even know were indeed we it is from this opening gibson drops us into this universe where quite literally anything goes whereas all is both what it often seems as well as being capable of being the polar opposite teeing things up for the near future the group meet a gang of battered refugees who speak of a recent attack on their settlement by outsiders an attack that has left their numbers few and their present state homeless this trouble eventually arrives at jaguar paw community a chaotic and unsettling sequence initiating the film proper and the misadventure our lead will find themselves undertaking the film is so much of so many things and yet like nothing that has preceded it with half the thrill in enjoying all of this content meld together and work the mountainous death march back to the aggressors own settlement that plays out calls to mind the leaner meaner westerns of yerster year its final act again calls upon elements from source texts of old predominantly that of ####s action films wherein the lead body would be subjected to a harsh and unabashed testing against the elements as they prove themselves to a loved one or family member often as they strive to rescue them against overwhelming numbers for all its material and the territory it covers the film is surprisingly subtle its depiction of these people who liquidate jaguar paw village as those with their own city like settlement and of being more advanced in the field of modernity offers both us and the lead character a fleeting moment away from all the mayhem to pause and reflect they possess skills in silk production their cooking and cuisine techniques dwarf our own characters primal hunt feast mentality whilst they even seem to actually launder their clothing the film hits the marks on mostly every level emotionally we are involved and care for these characters while the piece has a charged visceral quality throughout the kind that is rare in modern action films ,8

486,EN,-1639893422,this movie really is wonderful thanks mel i have to say that i read critics before and they have been disgusting as it seems there is a specific group of people who are ideologically unfit to judge mel work with fairness i believe the movie has lots to say but the basic message for me was do not be afraid this message should be targeted right at the heart of americans who are according to michael morre bowling for columbine the nation with the highest fear factor leaving far behind every other civilized nation in the murders per inhabitant ratio and being ready to follow their leaders in whatever bloody war they ask them to fight in beautiful pictures it shows that fear does not count fear is a sickness as flint sky rightly says with fear you either get slaughtered or you slaughter others without fear you do what is necessary to protect yourself your family and your hunting grounds and that it then you have always a new beginning fear never has done anything to improve a bad situation without fear you are free so i think mel wants to say that american can only be truly free if they stop being so afraid if fear is a sickness longing for security is a sickness too because it does not exist and will only poison your heart that what i thought when i watched this great movie ,10
487,EN,-1639893422,i had heard afore hand that gibson apocalypto was supposed to comment on iraq but had a distinct feeling when watching the film that a very exciting plot had been added a minute touch of politics and only in the high priest talk on the altar about the great maya people and their he almost said it manifest destiny that required blood every now and then to appease their god imo one may as well try to find iraq allusions in happy feet if we are trying to find allusions us may as well be represented by the conquistadors arriving in the last moments of the film and in the context of this film they arrive to put an end to the gruesome and gory maya culture the plot of the film is very small and simple with hardly any subplots but it is engaging we have an out and out spotless hero in jaguar paw who strives to get back to his wife and kid whom he left in a hole in the ground when his village was raided by the mayas the pre raid village is peaceful and people in the happy valley like a terrestrial paradise that can hardly be representative of saddam iraq the chase sequence that takes up one third of the film keeps viewers on the edge of their seats and is only flawed by that ancient movie clich that we cut from a shot where the pursuers are three steps behind the hero to a shot where the hero evidently has time to stop for a pensive close up while pondering what to do next whereas the pursuers are suddenly half a mile behind him did they stop for lunch but all in all eucalyptus or whatever the inscrutable title is certainly watchable and has reminiscences of boorman emerald forest as well as roots and first blood but it is certainly entertaining ,6
488,EN,-177045008,this movie is about a struggle for power between two men the pretentious upstart michael corleone who is trying to establish his legitimacy as godfather and hyman roth the most powerful crime figure on the planet whom michael both hates and wants to emulate the movie also shows michael depravity and hypocrisy while committing the most vicious acts in the name of the family he is actually systematically targeting for destruction every one closet to him michael is nothing but a phony he reveres his father vito who is his role model but he can never be another vito vito was respected and loved while michael is feared and loathed vito attracted people inspired confidence was acknowledged a leader while michael repels people away everyone close to michael is driven away or killed tom freddie kay pentangeli they are on to michael and michael knows it so he must have them eliminated the character of michael corleone is one of the most chilling characters in cinema history michael is cruel and depraved yet tries to pass himself off as decent and moral but that is a front which masks his greediness and deceit everything he touches he destroys michael is so nasty and mean that he even fights hyman roth the one man who has real affection for michael but even that is not enough for michael for michael being a predator roth good will is a sign of weakness to be exploited the depth of michael depravity is bottomless and in the end the man for whom family meant everything has no one he has either murdered or driven away everyone he is alone when this movie was first released oh those so many years ago i liked it recently i watched the movie again this time the movie was not that good my main objections to the movie are the repeated use of flashbacks and the character of michael regarding the flashbacks they ruined the continuity of the movie is this movie about michael or is it about the first godfather second the character michael is so overblown and two dimensional that not even al pacino excellent performance could totally save it it seemed that what michael needed was a therapist to help him work through his misplaced aggression michael feels the need to defend his family but defend them against what moreover michael is married is the father of two children is educated and thoroughly middle class this profile does not suggest someone who is likely to be directing an organized crime syndicate sorry it just does not wash and when michael has his older brother murdered even though his brother is mentally challenged that defies all logic even for michael for whom the family comes first if this movie is supposed to be a dramatic study of a deeply confused man who harbors paranoid delusions of persecution mixed with a big dose of grandiosity then this movie is interesting however if this movie is trying to suggest that an intelligent college educated married family man who has the option to go legit would be interested in pursuing a career in organized crime then this is stretching literary license a bit far why not have michael run for political office instead now that could make for an interesting and credible movie ,10
489,EN,-1005726734,its a good film not very original as i felt i was watching a new version of kick ass but it had some really great aspects the action scenes were wonderfully put in scene the story approach is indeed like john hughes would have shot a super hero film which worked perfectly for me in regards of a spider man film because this was something i missed about all the previous films the coming of age factor tom holland was perfectly cast there is no doubt he is peter parker and he is spider man with the right among of youth naivety great performance and absolutely convincing also the choice of michael keaton as vutlure was not only a pitch perfect ironic casting choice but also the absolute right one because he took that role really seriously and delivered a wonderful performance really menacing in many aspects and it was role you could have easily overacted the weakest point of the cast for me was laura harrier who was not particularly bad but just very boring marisa tomei was a bit wasted and it was a positive surprise that they really kept robert downey jr appearance short do not get me wrong i love him and his tony stark but he left to spotlight to holland and spider man which was the right thing after captain america civil war felt more like an iron man film than a captain america film why gwyneth paltrow tho received such a high billing for her cameo will ever be a huge mystery to me same goes to zendaya who had more like a side kick part but at least she was fun really loved jon favreau and good to see danny glover the soundtrack worked perfectly and the screenplay had some fun dialogues and nice surprises great entertainment,8

492,EN,-155461643,david fincher is a great director but not really one you would associate with the notions of marriage romance and love his name is more characteristically attached to dark thrillers exploring the depths of human depravity the way a serial killer relentlessly hunts his prey in se#en for instance or the curdling of friendship through the creation of a billion dollar enterprise in the social network why then has fincher turned his attention to gone girl because this tale exploring marriage romance and love adapted from gillian flynn best selling novel of the same title tucks itself perfectly into his wheelhouse fincher brews an intoxicatingly bitter stew out of flynn characters and ideas blending tragedy loss and even farce into a fascinating film that as shocking bleak and entertaining as it is thought provoking nick dunne ben affleck wakes up one day to find that his wife amy rosamund pike has mysteriously disappeared it perhaps ironic or fitting that he spent the morning complaining about their upcoming fifth anniversary to his twin sister margo carrie coon soon the police are investigating amy disappearance and clues start quite literally popping up that suggest she might very well have been kidnapped or killed as details of his souring marriage begin to come to light nick finds himself morphing from desperate husband into potential murder suspect in the blink of an eye and the turn of a media cycle but amy side of the story yields new suspects including her obsessive ex boyfriend desi neil patrick harris and twists that go deeper and darker than anyone would expect these days films emerging from hollywood fall easily into categories and genres but not gone girl the first half of the film is a taut tense thriller a grim whodunnit which colours details and doubt into the mystery surrounding amy disappearance nick and margo speak of amy with a surprising callousness whereas amy diary entries paint a picture of a fairytale romance gone awry we watch nick kiss amy in a sugar storm outside a bakery even as it becomes harder to believe in his innocence after she disappears then as more clues are unearthed and the plot deepens fincher spins his film into the realm of satire before he even comes to trial nick finds himself sorely tested in the court of public opinion he flashes an awkward smile next to a poster of his wife and is immediately branded as a callous murderer by gossipy news anchor ellen abbott missi pyle he charms his way through an interview with reporter sharon schieber sela ward and somehow manages to wrest back the sympathy he lost it a delicate game of styling oneself for public view a notion all the more relevant in the media obsessed era of facebook and instagram in which we now live that not all however the finest and possibly most disturbing element of gone girl is the strain of pitch black humour that runs right through it nick and amy are tied nay trapped together by their personalities their choices their circumstances strictly speaking it should play out as a tragedy instead fincher almost effortlessly finds the horrible dark comedy of it all in the midst of this strangely effective blend of high melodrama and bitter farce fincher even hits upon quite a few home truths he may be painting an extreme portrait of a dysfunctional marriage in gone girl but the myriad ways in which a far less unusual pair of people can trap each other in love lust and lies come through very clearly anyway fincher is known to be a taskmaster with his actors but they would probably agree it works out for the best here he teases a remarkably sensitive and ambiguous performance out of affleck who plays the shadows that lurk within nick with just enough charm to have anyone believe that he maligned or very guilty indeed it a fine line to walk but he pulls it off pike who spent much of her career drifting beautifully through films while never quite giving away too much of herself as an actor delivers a career defining performance as amy from the well bred socialite of her parents bestselling amazing amy books through to the sad bitter wife who wants more from nick than he can give her pike plays every shade of the character from light to dark with astounding skill the final film can feel disjointed and inexplicable to some what precisely is fincher trying to say with this film that flits from genre to genre it not a straight up thriller and its social commentary comes so wickedly barbed that it might be missed completely as the layers of crime and mystery are peeled away but take it for what it is a dizzying occasionally brilliant study of the institution of marriage taking to terrifying hilarious extremes the question of whether we can ever really trust the people we claim to love and gone girl is a thrilling electric and very unusual treat ,8
493,EN,-155461643,the most interesting thing about gone girl for me is the fact that underneath all the director mastery is kind of a typical twisty thriller that in other hands could have left much weaker impression you can see perfect stranger for example to help you imagine how it could look this film truly made me think that david fincher can if needed elevate any material make a very impressive movie almost from any script and like a magician make us not see most of its flaws i am not saying the source material here is bad but its screen adaptation certainly could look much less convincing and fresh much more problematic in one interview david fincher said that he shot ### hours of footage for this film and this is probably one of the keys to how he does this magic squeezing everything he can from the cast and the crew this is one of david fincher best movies although on paper it kind of should not be ,8
494,EN,-155461643,all through the year we have been waiting for exceptionally good movie expectation are high for some movies but they failed to deliver mostly well this is the kind of movie one can go for without a flinch keeping behind the well written story of the movie what really surprise me was the fact that ben affleck acted so well in this movie frankly speaking his not my favorite hollywood actor at all however he nailed this time rosamund amy was really really phenomenal and fantastic in the movie a mixture of sheer innocence and delusional yet complete psycho and wicked lady at the same time the best for me is how the movie highlight the ominous stage in the married couple life in more realistic way ,9
495,EN,-155461643,i just want to confess that i did not see the movie that being said you must be asking what right do i have to write a review well i watched the trailer and figured out where the movie was headed before it was half way done it seemed all too obvious that the escalating suspicion had to have a twist and it did predictable at that the acting looked fine as well as the craft of film making but the plot not so much typical and average so i gave it a # i am just glad i read a review with a spoiler so i did not have to actually watch the movie just to see if the ending was exactly what i figured it would be from watching half of the trailer if you cannot guess the ending from the trailer then i would say go ahead and see the movie as it does look pretty good if you can ignore the obvious far fetched twist that made an otherwise believable movie a clich ,5
496,EN,-155461643,this is a really brilliant film and was in good hands with david fincher but i could not help remembering how utterly fantastic thrilling and scary the original book by gillian flynn was how for the first time i actually felt unsafe reading a book due to the massive twist in one of the first person narratives one of the flaws in the film is that the character of amy played in an intensely creepy and brilliant manner by rosamund pike was not given all the details of her past her life and relationship with her parents and more into her relationship with nick to fully explain why she did the things she did nick comes off quite quickly to the audience as being the unlikable bastard the public in the film believe and also the relationship with his dad is just hinted as being strained in the film and does not explore why they do not like each other much the ending unfortunately is pretty poor compared to the one in the book using only ambiguity although the movie is well shot and acted finally giving the typical hollywood audience something new and engaging it simply did not carry enough of the urgency and depth that the novel had ,7
497,EN,1249590777,simply put boogie nights goes on my short list of best movies that i have ever seen i enjoyed how the movie presented a story about the porn industry in a way that was simultaneously tragic and humorous the movie conveys its message using creative original cinematography in addition to scenes that were perfectly orchestrated by the end of boogie nights i was pleasantly surprised at how well each character in the movie had been developed as to tell a meaningful story for me the length of the movie did not matter because the whole # hours ## minutes was needed to effectively complete the main story involving mark wahlberg character and the smaller adjacent stories involving the other characters each actor in the ensemble cast has a unique way of making you feel sympathetic towards his her character don cheadle character portrayal as a porn filmmaker struggling to become a businessman was particularly touching he seemed to steal all the scenes he was in when you factor in a ## style soundtrack that compliments the movie very well the picture serves as a memorable film that will stay in your consciousness long after you have seen it ,9
498,EN,1249590777,this is an excellent movie that is vibrant colourful and powerful the performances are all very good but the big surprise is the return of burt reynolds his performance is the most notable and he duly rewarded with a golden globe and an academy award nomination boogie nights is about the pornography industry in the ## and how it all fell apart in the ## the first half revolving around the ## is plausible and believable entertaining and informative although the film falls apart in the second half and descends into a lot of unnecessary graphic violence eddie adams mark wahlberg is the protagonist of the movie he is spotted one night at a club by porn king jack warner reynolds and is offered a deal to star in a movie warner remarks that i just know there somethin wonderful under those jeans just waitin to get out and that marks the entrance for eddie into the sleazy slutty though human world of porn and sex boogie nights follows his first appearance as a naive young actor to a drug hampered egomaniacal lunatic who spirals down into the world of crime and cocaine along the way it deals with sub plots dealing with pornography and the surrogate families that establish themselves amidst the echelons the prejudice that society carries to porn stars and the dirty utterly disgraceful life they lead although the film deals with sex and porn there is not an obscene amount of it and the director censors these scenes so it is not explicit the viewers gather that eddie adams or dirk diggler the pseudonym he assumes for acting has a prodigious member lurking under his jeans but until the final scene all we see to indicate that is the stunned reactions by peers and onlookers the script is very good but the film is overly long it could be called an epic at a length of ### minutes but the time passes quickly despite boogie nights flaws and shortfalls it is a very good movie worthy of the acclaim it received nine out of ten ,10
499,EN,1618104314,dance with wolves is a very gripping magnificent film i put this film off for years because i thought it would be horrible despite winning best picture well this movie is a true epic of the #### my only complaint that this movie is a little too long i am not a big fan of three hour movies even if it avatar or lord of the rings like those two i dealt with it and watched the whole film this is about a civil war soldier named john dunbar who is exiled out in the middle of nowhere while he is there he and the local sioux tribe becomes friendly with each other kevin costner is pretty good here his haircut in some scenes reminded me of mel gibson from braveheart graham greene is magnificent as kicking back or whatever his name is the score for the film is truly memorable i cannot remember a good score from the #### as good as this one the cinematography is unbelievable too there are a few scenes that choked me up they were written very well this is a very good movie certainly better than goodfellas i rate this film # ## ,9
