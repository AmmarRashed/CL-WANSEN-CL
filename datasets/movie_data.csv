en,-800777728,i love science fiction and i hate superheroes but i credit the x men series with giving me an appreciation for them x men has showed me that in the proper context with some great writers superheroes movies do not have to be the lowest form of sci fi entertainment days of future past seemed to confuse some people as it not part of the trilogy and therefore it timeline is off the ending of the film also creates a paradox which eliminates certain mistakes made in the other films in layman terms some of the things that happen in the other x men movies never happen because of days of future past in an undetermined era sometime between the end of the original film and last stand a new enemy has been targeting mutants these machines meant to eliminate the mutants have malfunctioned and are now targeting humans as well the machines are made with mutant dna and therefore have the combined forces of all the mutants it come in contact with making them unstoppable the only chance the x men have is for one of them to go back in time and stop the machines from ever being built wolverine is the only one with a mind strong enough to survive the trip and is sent back to the ####s where he meets the cast of x men first class while difficult for non sci fi aficionados to understand this film was not only extremely well written but serves dual purposes for the series first it brings both casts together in an extreme fashion and it a tremendous gift for the fans second it allows the writers to undo mistakes from the last stand which was at the time set to be the final x men film the ending to days of future past effectively explain that everything that happened in last stand never happened as it was part of an alternate timeline this allows the writers to bring back characters like prof x who is seen killed in that film for possible future films it really was an ingenious move for the franchises future but it also allowed fans to experience the old timers and the new class working together in a huge diverse and very impressive cast seldom are superheroes films so complicated or as well written as days of future past the writing is out of this world the cast is full of stars and the special effects were absolutely amazing love it or hate it superheroes are part of the science fiction genre but days of future past was simply incredible and for that it our latest must see movie ,9
en,-800777728,the movie is absolutely incredible all the performances are amazing especially james mcavoy michael fasbander and jennifer lawrence if you have not seen any of the other x men movies then i highly recommend checking them out before watching this one because you will appreciate days of future past so much more not only is the movie the best in the x men saga but it is also funny suspenseful gripping and action packed i absolutely love the storyline in this film as well one of my favorite scenes of this movie was quicksilver is there anyone who does not like the guy because he is amazing i just wish they could use the same actor for the avengers age of ultron mystique my favorite mutant has a huge role and so that amazing in the final scene when mystique is deciding whether to kill trask or not and the camera is switching between past and future best part in my opinion i loved how the movie plays slow music for the scene it means so much in such little of a tune i loved x men and i have already seen it twice i do not plan at stopping at that either ## ## stars ,10
en,-1018312192,in a cinematic era dominated by reboots and mindless blockbuster franchises rise of the planet of the apes does indeed rise above the rest this is in whole due to the startling performance by serkis the man behind gollum and jackson king kong has created through motion capture and facial recognition technology an ape character that is nothing short of miraculous serkis gives us caeser who is every bit the primate but serkis offers such subtle nuances and gestures that the character outperforms his human counterparts this is truly deserving of an oscar should the academy finally get its head around this hybrid style of acting the technology is now so good you can allow yourself to forget you are watching a cgi character but it is down to serkis why you believe that character has life and sentience you will want to rise up and follow him too the story is told with equal subtlety while it contains all number of clich s that will swell your heart and stir your compassion newcomer wyatt directs with a purpose there is a sense that there has been great thought about how man can fall and apes rise in their place the audience is left to fill in the story without having the plot points force fed by the climatic end it is enough that there is escape for the audience to know the human oppressor has given way to the nobler and indeed humane race more reviews at lookbeyondreviews blogspot com ,8

en,-1084746746,okay first things first this is not on the level of shrek or even monsters inc in terms of the storyline nor the subtle or not so subtle modern references tons of cliches abound but do not let that get in the way of your enjoyment watch it without being a grumpy cynic and you will come away satisfied for the # ticket you just paid it a film that will make you smile along the way and maybe sniffle at the end this was not meant to be an astract masterpiece it was meant as a fun for all ages film and it definitely succeeds basic storyline of # mammalian misfits coming together to save a baby boy the voice casting was perfect john l is especially fitting as the clumsy sloth the others barely have lines the small rodent squirrel is also good for some short comic relief along the way as he tries hard to bury its acorn it was nice to see how they kept manny reason for being a loner mysterious until the almost very end what made this movie enjoyable for me were the fantastic job the animators did with the whole body expressions this is like watching a cg muppets sesame street the fur and fat undulates muscles stretch and contract conveying a very comical feel manny fur and sid belly were especially well done unfortunately they focused so much on the animals the humans were left as an afterthought too robotic but you do not see much of them anyway i also love how there were very little saccharine songs ahem disney to revolt you it wonderful to see how well cg and people talent is coming along this presents a much more level playing field for the movie studios disney definitely does not own this joint which is a great thing since their stuff has been uninspired of late i can easily and heartily recommend this film seeing as how the competition the last # weeks have been utter garbage so go on watch it and bring the kids ,9
en,-1591406591,i read the book from sebastien japrisot last year i was very caught up with the story touched by the characters and very moved by the stories of these soldiers in the absurdity of world war i now regarding the movie the plot and the characters are still good to fully enjoy it you must like the style of jp jeunet and also audrey tautou she plays well but she carries the whole movie on her shoulder so you would better not hate her the contrast between the very clean non war scenes and the battles is too strong the fairy tale paris of #### and the mud and the blood of the battle field are too different to be in the same movie i think more realistic scenes of paris and bretagne would have made the story more believable to conclude i would highly recommend to people who are not sure to go see the movie or the disappointed ones to read the book it is on the overall much better than the film ,5
en,-836740088,the film gattaca is a very good one especially if you are in to good controversial movies the film shows a lot of where the future may be heading the future of genetics it makes you ask yourself how far are we really going to go with genetics andrew niccol does an excellent job the acting is an even bigger bonus not only is it a great film but it also teaches a good lesson never give up no matter what anybody says any film that does this great in direction acting and plot deserves a ## ,7
en,-1171836916,the title of this film had put me off seeing it also the fact that josh hartnett is the lead did not do it much favours i do not have much against the guy but he seems to make every character he plays turn into josh hartnett and that is why it seems that he brings out a movie every few years or so saying that once this film got going he had drawn me into his character rather well and i actually believed i was watching a guy with the weirdest name slevin and not josh hartnett the film is based around mistake identity slevin has come into town after losing his job flat and girlfriend all in one day he has come to new york to stay with his friend nick fisher such a good friend that when he arrives he is not there and still has not returned the following morning leaving slevin to make himself at home slevin then meets nick neighbour lindsey liu who instantly falls for slevin charm and i am sure manhood considering she gets a complete eyeful with him only wearing a bath towel moments after she leaves another knock at the door produces two heavies both of whom work for the boss freeman and have orders to bring in nick fisher despite not being fisher slevin has no way of proving otherwise and is dragged in front of the boss who is demanding the ninety six thousand that he fisher owes him or kill his arch nemesis the rabi kingsley son to wipe off his debt slevin leaves to ponder and almost instantly is dragged in front of the rabi who also believes he is nick fisher nick fisher happens to owe the rabi thirty three thousand and slevin has forty eight hours to pay up what to do next the narrative is very jumpy and the story twists and turns throughout and you find yourself guessing and then second guessing what is going to happen to this poor guy who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time he must somehow come up with a plan to worm his way out as he is no killer and has no money to his name i wo not let you in on anymore as you wo not know which way this film is going and it will have you confused until the very end where every little seed of detail falls into place and i have to say it works bloody well the cast is full of a list stars and not one of them disappoints as well as the leads we are treated to a bit of bruce willis and stanley tucci both of whom are very good in their roles it is not only the plot that takes surprising turns it is also each character all of which seem to have a trick up their sleeve at some point and all the actors present their tricks with surprise and intrigue it is a thinker and if you are not really watching you will become confused it is not a crime thriller more of a dark comedy the first half is very quirky and the dialogue is sharp and snappy and some of the best pieces of dialogue i have heard in a while all delivered with great punch from each actor including hartnett it was a film that had me thinking but also had me laughing what more can you ask for one minor fault i have with it however is the lack of direction shown in a few very poor shots there are also a few jump cuts which make very little sense and there was not much point of them at times they make you notice several continuity problems and to be fair they need not have done it so for me the choice of shots and some of the editing does let it down but the acting story and dialogue do make up for that the first half is quirky showing some poor filmmaking and the second half becomes dark a complete change of tone and shows some great filmmaking especially in the editing it is like two different films and both were very good let it all sink in and laugh along and i tell you you wo not be disappointed # # tolli check out my blog www tolli movieworld blogspot com,8
en,-1171836916,i really felt i needed to write this comment because the one just before made me so angry if the prior user had paid a little more attention to this film he would have noticed how intricate and brilliant the plot was i do not want to give anything away of this film but i strongly recommend this film to anyone i would agree that you spend the first ## minutes in confusion because of its fast paced plot but by the end your sympathies for individual characters are all over the place all i can say is go and see it and give it your full attention then you would not be on this website saying it does not make sense enjoy the film ## ##,10
en,616211544,i find it hard to enjoy movies where the main characters are despicable in this movie there are way too many characters like that and the main character micky ward is kind of dull and tricky to relate to at all the characters also develop in a weird way as in a bad one throughout the movie and so does the story itself leaving us with an ending that in my opinion did not do justice to the few characters i liked what really killed the movie for me though was some of the boxing scenes especially the ko s are simply awkwardly enacted and look silly i am aware of the fact that it hard to make a scripted boxing fight look good but thats not an acceptable excuse for it looking bad ,6
en,616211544,the onion skin layers of human reality are brilliantly teased out in this drama from the competing strong females in micky life to the jealousy within families how people are driven to fight for survival and the simple actions that lead to success over the complexities that thwart and because there is so much good acting on view the female elements in micky life are all brilliantly portrayed apart from mark wahlberg and christian bale and the excellent melissa leo the drama is very compelling although this is about a part of a boxer career the boxing strands do not outweigh the drama outside the ring which is good because the boxing is what in my opinion ultimately lets the film down let me explain a little further without spoiling the plot there is considerable evidence within the film of micky good nature his loyalty and his strength of character but there is also a great deal of his weaknesses on show too there is an attempt to transfer this personality to the boxing ring and it does not for me work it is still a very watchable and enjoyable piece of drama but the intended feel good ending is out of keeping with the excellence that has gone before i award it seven out of ten for the superb acting but as a film it is not up there with the best ,7
en,-639976942,i went to go see iron man on my day off although being a huge fan of marvel comics in general i was not really a huge fan of iron man but the movie was worth a check out robert downy jr was brilliant as tony stark he actually reminded me of nic cages take on johnny blaze ghostrider the good thing about the movie was that it tried to be entertaining and not too political which at one point became my fear in the movie the special affects and the awesome action are what stop this movie from its storyline which although deals with morley the birth of a hero and a little a less on the movie rolling along side but because robert downy jr was just so hilarious as iron man i was just willing to let that go to sum it up iron man might not be the biggest or the best comic to big screen action movie it certainly lives up to it advertising and delivers and entertaining flick which is worth a look at and i certainly would not mind checking out a sequel to it iron man # # out of ## fully charged ,9
en,-639976942,i finally saw this movie last night on dvd despite doing exceptionally well at the box office i just never was that interested in seeing iron man and only watched it after a friend gave me the dvd in hindsight i am glad i saw it but think you should know at the onset that i am not a huge fan of superheros and comic books this means that the film did manage to win me over but also that i have no knowledge of the story nor do i have the devotion to it that a typical fan might have take this for what you will since there have been a bazillion reviews for this film already mine will be rather short and i wo not even bother discussing the plot others have already done this very well instead let first talk about what i liked the film was very slickly made and i really enjoyed the first # # of the film the iron man character and how he came to be was original also i was thrilled that gwynneth paltrow character was not like the one she played in sky captain uggh having a tiny bit more depth and not behaving as stupidly robert downey was very good as a world weary jerk who grows as a result of his near death what i did not particularly like was jeff bridge character it just was not interesting and bridges seemed awfully one dimensional additionally while i am sure fans loved the final portion of the film it was a let down for me because it was all action the previous # # of the film was bolstered by good writing and dialog but the end was all special effects still i must admit that they were very very good special effects final verdict a very good comic book film but not quite as well made or as interesting as the dark knight fyi the character pepper potts appears to be a homage to the ladies played by the monty python actors in their series series regular graham chapman coined the term pepperpot to refer to these dowdy and severely unattractive middle aged ladies update # #### i just re saw this film and the second time i was even more impressed with it robert downey great performance the terrific soundtrack and the wonderful plot it simply an amazing film ,6
en,888363545,the hp movies get better every time a new installment comes out the cast is great the special effects are perfect and the story rocks what else could you want in a movie first of all daniel radcliffe fits the harry potter part perfectly he has the same whatever i just want to get through the school year kind of attitude just like in the books this movie was also the perfect length every scene was well done and i think the director did a fantastic job also many teenagers along the female variety found some of the guys in here very attractive including myself but that not really relevant anyway i think this movie was so well done and although the next film is not expected to come out for a while i really am looking forward to it ,10
en,288564766,how surprised should i be that it turned out as it did just another vehicle for disseminating propaganda so many movies are not for storytelling or entertainment but are subtle vehicles for disseminating propaganda dangerous propaganda which has yielded special victim groups tremendous power and influence at the cost of many lives and most importantly the truth watch this film for surely in the future it will be studied by our survivors just as we study joeseph gobbels work i have to fill this with ## lines but what can i write when the stench of this latest work of excrement fills my senses so here i write a few more lines as filler ,1
en,288564766,this rough story just had nothing to it first in walked denzel with an ego so big i was surprised his head fitted through the door he mostly played the part of a hostage negotiator even though he was not a hostage negotiator if that makes any sense not far behind was jodie foster who looked seriously wasted like she had a big time drug problem or was totally anorexic or whatever it is that the hollywood elite get up to she was probably brought in to help break up the story into bite sized chunks or scene switching as it is known but her role was so flimsy you could have cut her out of the story all together and it would have made no difference the story itself revolved around a gang of bank robbers who raided a bank but stole nothing apparently this was done to draw the police attention to a safety deposit box which held evidence linking the bank boss to nazi dealings during the second world war what the exact nature of the dealings were was never revealed the bank robbers must have been very righteous and honourable people risking a lifetime of imprisonment simply to get the truth out why they could not have gone to the police got a search warrant and disclosed everything is beyond me instead they beat humiliated and stripped the hostages who amounted to nothing more than innocent civilians and probably traumatised them for life it is difficult to build sympathy with the public no matter how righteous your cause by degrading helpless captives like this i fully agree that nazi collaborators should be exposed and punished but victimising the most vulnerable people in our society namely the old and children yes a young child was also in there is difficult to swallow it did not seem to fit in with the honourable intent of the bank robbers to tie drag and traumatise these people overall not a bad movie could have been better with more thought ,5
en,288564766,i think william shatner should have taken the lead role in this film because denzel is way past his prime mr shatner should write and star in star trek ## with denzel denzel could play bivouac another vulcan tuvok uncle and old bill shatty could play himself again i will go on to say that denzel was very superb when i saw him speak to mr shatner once when i saw them together i asked mr shatner if he would sign his autograph to my girlfriend and write beam me up scottie but he said he could not do that and then i was handled rather roughly until i was outside again ,6
en,-1057031135,watchable sci fi action film but nothing like as deep as it would at first appear the story is overly contrived the flaws in the central premise never fully dealt with and the ending far too simplistic to make this an overall satisfying experience the ostensibly complex conundrum at the heart of this film whether preventing a predicted event actually negates the concept of fate upon which precognition rests is conveniently swept aside in favour of mindless action and the futuristic setting merely an excuse for spielberg to play with some expensive cgi toys the plot holes become more gaping with each viewing see it once and enjoy the visuals but do not think about it too hard ,8
en,-1057031135,the problems with this film are what come up the most the only reason john anderton ran into crow was because of what he saw then why would the pre cog have a real vision if the only reason he would kill crow was if he saw the vision does that make sense i enjoyed the slant on anderton son and the emotion tom cruise put into the character do we ever have an action hero who is also a dope head this is one of tom cruise best performances the movie should have been darker during the action sequences when colin farrell character is chasing cruise through the apartment building and auto production plant i just found the music to be happy and spielberg was trying to be comical the movie reaches it climax about ## minutes before it ends i would have preferred if the movie ended with anderton actually finding out what happened to his son the ending comes on to fast and sets a pace that the rest of the movie had not set # ## good,9
en,-1057031135,minority report may just rank as one of steven spielberg best pieces of work it long alright but at ### minutes long it is fulfilled by great special effects and non stop thrills it also features tom cruise in one of his better roles he has played the action hero in mission impossible before but in a film such as this it much more complicated what makes minority report so intriguing is it complex plot featuring the main character john anderton tom cruise who is foreseen to commit a murder and he is racing against time to either prove his innocence or change the future a concept so complex it leaves you wondering what will really happen in the first place such an intelligently written conflict for a plot done with mere complexity that keeps us on the edge of our seats wondering what anderton will do until a conclusion is finally reached it is a plot dependent on the very choices he makes that decide the fate of the entire story as other characters coherently become involved by their desires and motives in the meantime everything slowly unveils itself resulting in many surprises and twists to come resulting in a great amount of suspense next to schindler list it may just be spielberg darkest film but also one of his more entertaining more importantly it is the supreme bundle of a science fiction mystery suspense action adventure and a thriller steven spielberg has certainly made a name for himself in the world of mystery suspense thrillers as justified by the many futuristic concepts depicted in minority report rarely if ever does it not compel or even captivate # out of ## ,9
en,-1057031135,steven spielberg has made numerous memorable movies in his illustrious career minority report is one of his finest the complex plot might confuse the average viewer but that does not take away the magnificence of this movie in #### an organization called precrime tries to prevent future crimes from taking place with the help of precogs does it sound complicated well it is however the central theme of this movie is how tom cruise character deals with the world on knowing that his son is probably dead there are a number of futuristic devices in this film which have been replicated in real life and many of them may become a reality in the coming years multi touch retina sensors spider cams are a few of the many devices that are presented in this movie this thrilling movie goes by in a breeze and for that the credit must go to the director for giving the story a nice pace the performances are spot on and even the secondary characters with small roles perform brilliantly i would say that this movie must be seen ,9
en,-1616571358,this actually is the sci fi treat for this decade to close in a heroic way neill blomkamp has given us a masterpiece and after all this hype before the opening of this film who could thought it would meet such high standards the actors have given their best shot the cgi team produced results never before seen sound editing and cinematography were top notch soundtrack photography etc all excellent the plot was a perfect blend of drama comedy social messages agony and plenty of really good action the director after his previous exceptional work made an instant classic cult film to be talked about for years to come kudos to peter jackson for trusting him this is a film you will enjoy if you like good cinema but not if you are expecting g i joe and the rise of the cobra or terminator salvation people are talking about holes in the plot and shaky cameras about clich s and predictable scenario about copycats and absurdity trust me if you enjoy good cinema you will enjoy district # watched it twice and it only got better ,9
en,-1616571358,as always let start with the basics pros great premise awesome special effects underlying commentary about the highs low of human nature fantastic immersion in the atmosphere the alien weapons were awesome they had a gravity guy even cons some weird parts some of the improvised dialog in combo with the thick accents was hard to follow at times this movie by far was the best sci fi movie i have seen in a long time it also shows up every other big movie this year that had ridiculous budgets and we are mediocre at best district # reminds us that it still the acting directing and writing that really make a good movie the main issue in my opinion that could drive some people away from the movie is the gross or really weird scenes here and there for example the nigerians eating the aliens to try and get their power however if those things do not really irk you then it all good i thought the best attribute of the movie was how it immersed me in the atmosphere or feel of district # the grime the smell the violence and all the other hardships that were forced upon the prawns i will say the violence was brutal but was not glorified or overdone like other movies the acting in d# was fantastic considering how much experience the cast had in fact the absence of a list stars added to the realism of the footage given everyone looked like a normal every day person in conclusion if you like pure sci fi then you should like this movie the aliens looked phenomenal the premise is very original the weapons were sick and the final ## ## min climax was spectacular ax,9
en,-1616571358,i have just watched avatar yesterday and it completely blew my mind the visuals were stunning and i thought it was one of the greatest movies to have been ever made i am still in the avatar euphoria yet yet yet this movie re composed my mind only to blow it away yet again the only difference is that it blew it away more absolutely than avatar did if you are not into the alien science fiction creature documentary stuff the off chance is that you might not like it i say off chance because so far there is only two people who i think will not care for it much my father and my sister but all the others the movie will make converts of this is how direction should be this is how pacing should be this is how humor should be woven into drama this is how the sound track should be this is science fiction at its best yet come to think of it i have been visiting imdb even since it came on and this movie actually made me register and write a review by zarquon this is the proverbial it ,10
en,-1616571358,a great film and pretty moving much better than any scifi flick i have seen since dark city i loved the fact it was set in south africa and it was a good setting for a film well it turned out well anyways i cant see why it has been a hit its well worth spending your money on a ticket to see it with the family this film delivers on all levels unless your a sad nit picker like some people are i cant imagine why anyone commenting on this film would give it a bad review its much better than any other scifi flick i have seen for a hell of a long time and thats no easy thing to achieve in my eyes im sure that this film will be with us for many years to come it will do excellent on dvd sales i can guarantee it i just hope that the second film offers as much as this one does well worth watching ,10
en,-1616571358,much hype too much hype has gone before and unfortunately this film fails to deliver yes the cgi is quite good really with wiki wiki wild wild weta and pj involved what do you expect yes the action scenes are sometimes compelling but sadly there is also # hours of footage which feels more like # because let face it the story is just not very interesting oooooh let have a clever commentary on racism let use aliens instead of an actual suppressed group of people because that will make it more original it will be ground breaking sci fi no wait this all sounds strangely familiar worst of all although this movie appears to be trying to make a statement about racism and most reviews actually buy into this it manages to include its very own racist overtones as blomkamp goes out of his way to show us again and again nigerians are either gangsters or hookers and no matter which of these two professions they may be pursuing they are universally uneducated and superstitious believing that by consuming their enemies they can absorb their power even the supposed hero is racist although apparently he is more strongly biased against aliens than nigerians and blatantly so at the start of the movie sadly he never grows to overcomes his views only finally working with some aliens because of self interest rather than any sort of recognition that his prejudices might have been founded on ignorance and closed mindedness all in all this movie was not utterly awful but it was rather boring and misguided i wish i would bought myself a prawn cocktail instead and i do not even like prawns ,4
en,-1616571358,that is the best word for my experience with this film disappointing i wanted to like this film i really did i thought i would all of the hype around it seemed for the first time in a while as though it was worth it as though it was deserved i am sad to say i was wrong what i thought would be a brilliantly conceived piece of cinema epic in scope and just reveling in gritty realism turned out to be just another summer action flick that was more concerned with its cgi than the issues it raised the premise from the trailers seemed interesting the aliens had technology we wanted but could not operate and we were somehow keeping this advanced race prisoner on our own planet causing god knows how many issues for both ourselves and them all for the sake of a military advantage and for all i know all of that could still have been taking place in this world only problem is we never saw it happening there were only a few times throughout the film that the story seemed to intersect this premise and none of them were at all satisfying the film starts as a mock documentary giving us the necessary information so we can grasp what we will be seeing for the next hour and a half this i will concede was brilliant i thoroughly enjoyed the first half hour of this film the gritty realism was there it seemed as though it would be raising some serious issues and it had a delightfully macabre atmosphere and feel to it then for no reason or warning at all we are thrust into a cinematic film rather than a documentary it was an odd unexpected and shocking change of pace i think it would have worked very well if they would kept it there but instead they insist on interweaving their documentary feel between the cinematic portions i believe this was done in an attempt to give different feels to the two stories all it accomplished though was to constantly force you to watch the film differently every ten minutes and when the two stories finally became one the documentary feel did not go away making the character study portion of this film hard to stomach there no point in studying a character we do not care about and feel detached from thanks to the documentary feel established earlier which brings me to another flaw of this film that made it difficult to watch it never really decided what it was about in the beginning it was about an alien race that had landed here ## years ago and had not left this portion was most enjoyable as it gave us a good window into this alternate world and showed the fallout of this tremendous event then the film became a sort of horror thriller as it became more focused on the story the mysterious substance and the mortifying transformations it was causing in wilkus van de merwe this was still interesting but definitely not as much as the feel before and wilkus mutating into a prawn seemed like it was a story element straight out of paul w s anderson resident evil films from here the story finally thought it might become a little more epic wilkus and christopher neither of which i really cared for decided they would try to break into this top secret lab steal the fuel back and make a break for the mother ship betrayals and surprises were abound but i did not care about any of them mostly because i could not care about the characters feeling too detached from them after the documentary style introduction to them during this portion the film was half action flick half character study of christopher both seemed out of place but the second one especially once again what is the point of studying a character we have no stake in after that the film just descended into action it actually managed to maintain its cinematic feel for about forty five minutes while all this was going on then suddenly we are back to people being interviewed and it closed as some kind of feel good documentary about christopher possible return and the unknown fate of wilkus all the while managing to avoid actually doing anything about all of the issues it raised so instead of an intellectual gritty and twisted sci fi experience we were given some kind of half thrown together action movie that pretended to be smarter than it was in essence the film could have been far more cerebral than it was the fact that it was not was the biggest disappointment of all for me all in all i give the film a # # it had some good moments but the story was bogged down by the relentless use of documentary inserts sans the forty five minutes previously stated that were a good excuse to slip in any information we would need to understand the upcoming scene but ultimately made the film feel too detached for the less than epic story it was telling ,6
en,-1616571358,i watched district # last night in a brimming auditorium in london on the second night of its general release and to be totally honest the audience reaction was mixed i speculate about half the attendees went home satisfied these would have been science fiction fans mainly but anyone who has a taste for the alternative will certainly have got a kick out of it i categorize myself as the latter in my humble opinion district # is a solid attempt to create an original sci fi film and it deserves credit for approaching a somewhat stale alien invasion genre and inoculating it with some innovative ideas district # is not without its faults however and there are more than a few in my opinion the film falls down in a few key areas # narrative direction this is not consistent throughout the film i e the style of storytelling alters as the film progresses but this is not done in a smooth or convincing manner and does more to confound than impress to elucidate on one annoyance part of the film is shot with shoddy hand held cameras and then suddenly it switches to standard camera type # plot laden with holes to be honest ok so i do not expect any sci fi film to be backed up by rigorous science or even governed by moderate rationality but there is only so much you can expect the average audience member to buy there are several inexplicable plot holes in the film for instance the earth bound aliens appear to harbour highly advanced weaponry which for some bizarre reason they choose not utilise instead they accept their impoverished circumstances and choose to trade their over sized weaponry for cat food meanwhile the alien mother ship has been hovering above johannesburg for ## years languishing in wait seemingly unperturbed by either alien or human intervention this is a ridiculous scenario if you stop and think about it there would be a global response to alien invasion and there would no doubt be hordes of scientists up there investigating it # acting the protagonist vikus is highly entertaining and i am not criticizing his performance at all by mentioning the acting the rest of the cast were quite woeful sometimes i agree that its good to get fresh faces onto the big screen but in all honesty i think a lot of the actors in this film were promoted above their station this probably has something to do with trying to use a ### south african cast apart from the distended asides this film really is worth watching if you fancy a turn away from the polished but predictable and usually tame hollywood efforts at science fiction # ##,7
en,-54095325,i have seen star wars probably ## ## times and empire about ## but had never watched them back to back on consecutive nights until the new dvd versions came out put me in the camp of those who feel the added digital effects are a desecration i want to see the movies the way they were released originally i simply tried to ignore the alterations and was successful for the most part it certainly is nice to see these films in widescreen with outstanding picture and sound quality i felt the same way after seeing star wars again that i have since #### it is the greatest achievement in the history of movies to my surprise however when i watched empire the next night i was disappointed it is a very well directed well polished movie but to my mind it lacks the visual graphic brilliance that helped make the original so extraordinary star wars and american graffiti the two masterpieces george lucas directed in his youth both have an incredible unmatched look lucas did not move the camera much but he made up for it with the amazing jukebox like style of what he photographed with it empire lacks that quality spoiilers ahead star wars was really a perfect story that ended with what is still the greatest action sequence ever the death star battle followed by the ultimate coda the throne room scene watching empire right afterward was a little jarring suddenly without warning we learn that despite destroying the ultimate power in the universe the rebels have gained no advantage and they are on the run stuck hiding on a miserable little ice planet with a single tiny base would not more fighters more systems have joined the alliance after the destruction of the death star how did the rebels go from ultimate victory to being nearly crushed so quickly another major shock to me and probably the biggest weakness of empire was the change in the relationships of the three main characters in star wars from the moment luke first saw leia he was in love with her who is she she beautiful so much so that he stood dumbstruck when he first entered her cell on the death star there were strong hints that leia reciprocated she kissed him half on the cheek half on the lips twice looked very nervous when he seemed dead in the final battle and certainly luke was in puppy love with her the entire film now all of a sudden in empire luke and leia are on screen together for about three minutes total and there is no hint of luke love for her without explanation now it all about han and leia who despite no hint of attraction in star wars are suddenly are madly in love i suspect there are three main reasons for this # unlike fisher and hamill harrison ford was not signed up for sequels he only agreed to come back on condition that his character was developed from the wisecracking cynical sidekick into the wisecracking cynical romantic hero lead this gave his career a great boost but in my opinion totally undercut the character of luke skywalker who should have been the emotional focus of the movie as he was in star wars # mark hamill disfiguring car accident in december #### after completion of principal photography on star wars made it easier to turn his character into a monk like asexual person the process that started in empire and finished in jedi in star wars hamill was a handsome though callow screen presence but after the accident despite plastic surgery he just did not look good it hampered his performance and basically destroyed his capacity to play a romantic lead # to the extent that lucas planned to have leia be luke sister a terrible decision that i suspect was not made until after the release of empire they obviously could not be romantically involved however their incestuous love for each other is all over star wars i think the decision to make leia and luke siblings only came after the radical character revisions in empire eliminated any romantic feelings between luke and leia and turned luke into a boring monk indeed empire greatest weakness is that it too heavy the dark side of the force was only briefly discussed in star wars but here it played up to an extent that the concept just cannot support yoda says that fear anger hatred lead to the dark side but how exactly is a human being supposed to avoid these emotions the force was fleshed out just the right amount i e not too much in star wars but here it is revealed not to make a whole lot of sense there way too much good vs evil that no longer presented in a fun style in empire it taken too seriously which reminds me of the lord of the rings movies not a good thing ,10

en,-1755890136,quentin tarantino django unchained takes place in the year #### and it begins with a man named dr king schultz who is looking for a man named django who can help him find and kill the brittle brothers schultz then finds django and other slaves marching in texas with the speck brothers schultz kindly offers to buy django and when the speck brothers refuse he kills one brother and cripples the other brother and his horse schultz pays the live brother and gets the respective papers for django ownership schultz and django then arrive at a bar in a small town near el paso and begin to discuss exactly why schultz has found him and what django will get for helping him identify the brittle brothers schultz explains that he is no longer a dentist but now a bounty hunter and that if django helps him he will give him his freedom ## dollars and his own horse after django immediately agrees to the terms schultz shows he is a bounty hunter by proving to the town that their sheriff is an outlaw and had a bounty over his head django and schultz make up a plan to have django act as his valet they arrive at big daddy plantation asking to buy one of his many slave girls for an outrageous price while schultz consults big daddy django is given free roam around the plantation to find the brittle brothers he shoots one dead on the spot whips the other till unconscious shoots him and schultz kills the last brother with a sniper rifle once this is done schultz asks what django will do now and he replies that he will try and find his wife brunhilde schultz decides to help django retrieve his wife from calvin candie candie land when they both arrive and try and make it seem like they are interested in buying one of calvin mandigo fighters one of calvin house slaves indicate that those are not their real intentions when this is realized a huge gun fight in calvin house breaks out and although schultz is killed in this django kills many but is captured once he runs out of bullets and is out numbered once django escapes his capturing and returns to candie land to rescue his wife he kills every last survivor and blows up the house in the process review tarantino films do have an immense amount of killing but that is the not the only focus that he brings to the movie screen throughout the movie there are many occurrences where the audience is caught laughing and the movie is no longer strictly serious one scene in particular that is put in to give some comedic relief is when big daddy sends a group of men to go kill schultz and django during this scene the group of men argue to each other about lack of sight when wearing the bags on their heads and whose fault it is this scene in particular makes it seem like it is more of a comedic movie rather than a serious one even a racial word such as the n word in this movie has more of a satirical side to it rather than one to demean a black person when i was watching this movie i was laughing from start to finish there were numerous parts of the movie that played to my sense of humor and got me to laugh even though this was about a serious topic the funniest actors of the movie in my opinion were jamie foxx and samuel l jackson jacksons part in the movie as calvin candie slave not only fits the time period but is outrageously funny and at times had me at the brink of tears and a serious ab workout the comedic relief in this movie makes it a lot more enjoyable to watch rather than a movie simply about a freed slave turning the tables when someone sees a tarantino film such as inglorious bastards or django unchained they think of a movie with massive amounts of action and gore this is true because in both films there is an immense amount of killing and we see this in the first scene of django as schultz violently kills one speck brother and cripples the other django and schultz travel through the movie first striking vengeance on the brittle brothers then going on the hunt for his lost wife throughout the movie killing and bloodshed cannot be escaped and is one of the main themes of the movie there are several scenes in the movie where action and violence are the main focus such as django dealing out his wrath on two of the brittle brothers and schultz sniping the other or the massive shootout in calvin candie house while some say the movie did have some moderately funny parts it was more of an act to relieve tension and kind of just thrown in the movie even though there were some parts like this they still saw it as a movie with a bunch of action and gore and not so much laughter parts such as the slave being torn to shreds or django wife being beaten in front of him or even when she was trapped in the heat box for torture really make your stomach churn and take away any sort of laughter or smile you once had it is his style of movies and it is either a hit or miss for the audience that watches his movies i saw django as more of a comedic action and gore movie rather than just strictly an action and gore movie the comedy of it was tied in at the right points and made the movie truly a joy to watch rather than just a long action movie ,9
en,-1755890136,let me make it clear i did enjoy most of it but i also found myself looking at my watch and hoping it would end sooner if there was a film this year that more than deserves the adjective excessive this is it it a decent film with plenty of action some very funny scenes and three of the best performances of the year jackson house slave is almost as good as washington performance he an interesting and complex character somehow who we cannot even imagine existed he the darker twin of scarlet mammy in gwtw way darker and just as fascinating there of course another star turn by de caprio puzzling magnetic depraved and ruthless and waltz creates another memorable character a foreigner who cannot comprehend what is going on in his world but who does not stop from taking advantage of the situation without losing his soul django is a hybrid of westerns and a very strange take on slavery looking at it through tarantino special lens he unable to edit himself and while he builds the tension and almost never loses our interest through django and schultz quest to rescue their lost princess i kept wondering why he overindulges all the time things do not clash here they explode with such magnitude that i was wondering why was not # d involved in the process i kept looking for guts flying and what happened to the nc ## rating there is much praise to give to the fact that he takes risks with his use of language and there is not a boring conversation in the entire film but when there is confrontation you almost feel like ducking or you will be hit by some of the flying organs much of the praise here should go to the way the old west comes alive with the costumes and art direction there is also the amazing job robert richardson does with his camera making the film look and feel like one of those spaghetti westerns he paying tribute to i loved the way he brings in franco the original django and interacts with this movie hero there of course some ennio morricone and a few other touches that show tarantino adoration of the genre is there a story well barely a lot of the film is about the feel of it like getting on a ride without expecting much depth and to be fair there should not be a iq test or some confusing plot twist to ruin the entertainment but i think spielberg knew how to control himself in saving private ryan by limiting the massacres to the first ## minutes a little restraint would have helped here who knows tarantino might have achieved his masterpiece another detail that is puzzling me we are hearing all this praise for the movie like it the second coming of peckinpah or the latest collaboration between benton penn and carpenter it as much fun as the best ## b movie but i am not sure about those accolades out there where was all this praise for the indiana jones films maybe they should have included more flying body parts and some more colorful language still enjoy it for what it is a ride that has plenty of movie syrup in it ,6
en,-1033757655,granted it not gone with the wind but who needs a antebellum epic to become one of the best movies ever made the fact that spielberg worked with a down right pitiful budget and against conditions of the sea earns him respect but then the writing and story were also downright awesome that scene where the quint talks about the indianapolis and gives grisly account of his survival sure it is seemingly meaningless to the story but it terrifies the other characters nice job this movie actually altered my childhood at first i was afraid to go near a bathtub by the time i was ## i realized that it was a movie and i realized i wanted to become an ichthyologist a scientist that studies fish thank you jaws you were the bomb ,9

en,432304174,these films are staples of my generation it seems hardly a sunday night would go by without one of them showing up on tv but upon revisiting them over the past few days i was surprised to discover that my impression of them was for the most part colored by the sequels and this first one is quite a bit different it truly is a classic of its time and as good as most comments say but let delve a bit deeper the strength of most films can be broken down to reasons of their individuality and generality active gestures and underlying environment the first are always easier to pick out and measure at a glance in fact most reviews of any film center on these this is easy to see here in the quirky characters of riggs and murtaugh how gibson and glover actively flesh out the chemistry around them we have a perfectly competent action vessel for them to act out in that fine this chemistry is what they relied on to create the franchise building it up to a family but i believe the film works and is significantly different to the sequels as much for their active presence as due to a presence of another sort the first thing to note is that here we have the transition from film noir more clearly than any other film i can recall right now the story begins with detectives on a case cops we are in a noir la chandler evocation of it suburban money prostitution sleepless nights of drifting the crime is a murder that would have been murder had the girl not leaped first from a balcony to her death wonderfully worthy of the jazz causality of film noir the transition from noir is that our detectives do the same suburban snooping around that marlowe would do but at every stop it erupts into gunfire and fireballs the world no longer fiddles its noir machinations of mystery and self but explodes disappearing you will notice that by the end we do not get as much as a vague suggestion about her suicide but we have the whole plan explained about the murder and drug trafficking plot the causality is flattened but the investigation itself still charms because it carries that sultry jazz echo of noir which brings me to the main thing i bring up in many other comments the experience of immersion the transition is from noir into action from that generality which in pure noir appears as an ambiguous fabric of fate where the ordinary schmuck finds himself enmeshed where space throbs with a mystery to the straighforward individuality of the action film where space is a material backdrop for acting out the transition means we get to see both when murtaugh first arrives at the murder scene by morning we have a marvelous shot of him on the street looking up at that fateful balcony our eye engulfed in bright light from above moments later he in the apartment ruminating as curtains flutter around him in the wind the shot introducing us to riggs place covers first a vast stretch of beach the first shot that introduces the villains that whole lighter in the arm scene is shot beneath a wonderful constellation of light bulbs none of these shots are held for longer than the story has use for them it not that kind of film but it truly evocative truly reflective about staring into the night ahead because it is always anchored in an underlying space with presence we have murtaugh contemplating a life without all these things on a boat and that boat is stationed on his front lawn you have some evidence of all this at work by looking at the much thinner sequels the villains and plot are as ridiculous but they bring riggs and murtaugh much more to the front ignoring the noir and spatiality noir disappeared in tv shows and cop films like this which fooled around with the plots or appearances but these were never the main shaping forces of noir its essence is preserved and taken further by someone like lynch entirely about that prelogical point in the story when it is still both a murder and a suicide ,8

en,-696399305,wow probably the best sequel i have seen in a film although the plot was a little weak as to carry on the hydra story line which was ok not the best idea but the action is off the chart which redeem that side of the story it well balanced the winter soldier is the darkest story we have come to encounter raising many deep seated questions about government and soldiers of war while also taking rogers on an emotional journey it also has the best action choreography among all of the mcu movies thus far whedon nyc battle in the avengers is beautifully shot and written but cannot compare to the hard hitting set pieces found in the winter soldier each building up to the bigger whole the russo brothers come from a background of directing television comedies such as arrested development and community and it extraordinary how well they handle a big budget action blockbuster from cinematography to pacing they do infuse their own style of comedy with fun references and a cameo other than stan lee functioning properly within the confines of the tone and story henry jackman captain phillips wreck it ralph x men first class also composes an adrenaline pumping score that sets the right mood every time there is one faultier in this film tho that could of been in this film anthony mackie as the falcon done a fantastic job in his role he looked amazing scarlett johansson as black widow done brilliantly as well but i felt like this film could of done with iron man or hawk eye to help captain america as well in this film as they were shield agents as well they were no where to be seen i think marvel failed on that point despite this film be fantastic because i think they could of been called in to help as well good thing about the story line as well is it revels what really happened to buck before he became the winter soldier i thought that was well put clear to understand also a good move was to bring back hayley atwell character peggy carter i think that was a nice touch to the film slightly emotional as well i never would of thought that you would get samuel l jackson robert redford in the same film together two brilliant actors that played there roles brilliant in this film i do not know if it just me but the fight scene were mental brutal just the way he throw he shield with such force it make you cringe to think what that must be like to get hit with that force this is a film well worth the money film i recommend watch on the big screen which as always with marvel film there is a scene mid credit that ties in with the avengers # film which revels surprising character if you have already know who they are a scene at the end of the credit roll this is a must see ,9
en,-696399305,this movie is great i walked into the theater with high hopes and was not disappointed the action was breathtaking and the story line kept me on the edge of my seat captain america really showed off his skills in this film too in the avengers and captain america the first avenger cap does not show off his skills before this film cap was one of the least popular avenger but this movie turned things around he is now one of the most popular avengers also falcon was a great addition to the marvel cinematic universe hopefully he will have an important role in the upcoming avengers films also the winter soldier was an amazing villain the twist of bucky being alive was excellent and the fact that he is now against cap is even better all in all this movie was a great addition to the marvel cinematic universe and set the tone perfectly for the avengers age of ultron ,10
en,1992860218,i like this film and i watch the dvd infrequently i know how good it is and for once i am not entirely sure why it works which for somebody who has not seen it is not very helpful but suffice to say it is enjoyable to watch all those involved in the making of this film deserve a collective pat on the back for producing a very good and entertaining piece of work i cannot give it full marks though because no matter how many times i watch it there is something in the film which does not add up and so far i have not been able to suss out what it is maybe its just me who is looking for something which just is not there but its just slightly annoying not being able to enunciate what the missing thing is anyway whatever it is apart this film requires your attention because the subtleties are numerous and the interactions are superb at times it seems there is a lot of hype surrounding this film and i would suggest anyone who has not seen it just watch the film and do not pay attention to any of it good or bad like i say it is an enjoyable film and well worth watching ,9
en,1992860218,i just love it when nearly # # hour run time serves no purpose this movie is so slow even handicapped subhuman monkey hybrid could keep up with the story it seems like that is a common factor here on imdb good movies always get metascore of ## ### and imdb rating of # # ## or something like that then l a confidential a movie you do not even have to watch to see it gets ## ### because f i n a l l y s o m e t h i n g e v e n i c a n w a t c h w i t h o u t d r o w n i n g i n m y o w n d r o o l truly a great movie if you are a bit slow or maybe maybe deaf do not care about audio that way you can put it play on # #x speed and maybe enjoy the ride a bit more ,2
en,1992860218,how does a potentially good movie jam packed with excellent talent manage to stumble into forgettable mediocrity it seemed the cast was tight and firing on all cylinders the director was doing his thing superbly and production whatever they do was more than adequate i guess so what happened did it seem like there were some major character disconnects it felt that a bit there were moments in the story when the plot was more like a disorganized smattering of unruly lice than some kind of a storyline was it too long again time is relative and for me this show was relatively too long predictable oh please this was your typical bad cop vs badder cop vs baddest cop i might be too hard on this flick i do not know i am probably spoiled by some of the quality tv crime drama you know the ones that have good writers and last an hour la confidential was just not a spectacular tale it was almost boring do not get me wrong this is not a bad movie it is actually pretty good it just not great to put it another way l a confidential is like a chevy corvette outfitted with a vespa engine all flash and no guts i apologize to those who loved the movie but i wo not lose sleep over it this story needs to be re buried in that woman smelly basement at least for me ,3
en,1117674556,spoilers included within it reminded me of how you feel during the uncertainty stages of falling in love and also when getting the nerve to speak up and take a chance the first five minutes set in the airport were beautiful and already got me crying i also really liked how it went from comedy to drama so seamlessly a lot of the comedy to me was wayyyyyyyyyy too silly though and pretty annoying the drama was very well done and my absolute favorite part was when the friend of the blonde woman confessed his love to her on those cards unbelievable and boy was he good looking i also liked how it portrayed different types of love from a crush to unrequited impossible love love of family sex but not the usual romantic love and even platonic love between a straight man and his trusty and loyal manager ironically probably the best relationship seemed to happen between the two porn stars that was adorable and of course the irony of how shy and sweet they were contrasting with what they were doing was priceless now for the negative side it was extremely superficial in that that the women were largely model quality gorgeous and the men loved them based on looks only they did not actually even know some of them the kid for example that is hardly love the two women that were not at least in this movie model quality gorgeous actually got screwed emma thompson and laura linney if the target audience for a romantic comedy is women that was not a wise move none of us women appreciated the fat jokes about hugh grant assistant natalie who looked great and was not fat in any way she was not a stick figure but looked like a woman is supposed to look marilyn monroe had that body type actually heavier and it seemed to work for her no one called her fat throughout her movies also ticking off the core audience another extremely annoying and ridiculous feature was that the model quality women were just handing themselves over to the men and they did not have to use any effort like claudia schiffer to liam neeson after talking to him for one minute i will make sure we see each other again and alan rickman character was not attractive and had no personality there is no way his secretary an attractive young girl would throw herself at him knowing he was married to boot and the guy going to the us that was just so ridiculous even worse than typical cheesy us movies and any beer commercial and even just shoot me where david spade only ended up with # supermodel i thought it was a dream that he was having on the plane he should have come back empty handed again ticking off the core audience besides the effort to win the person heart is the core action in a romantic comedy to leave it out and have the woman just hand herself to the guy is the same as having an action hero be asleep for # hours the bad guy walks up to him and then has a heart attack and dies at his feet kind of defeats the purpose of the movie in addition to being annoying this was clearly written and directed by a man it was slanted in that direction i just was not prepared for that type of just shoot me style misogyny in a hugh grant romantic comedy there was none of that in notting hill four weddings etc which were ironically written and directed by the same man note women go to romantic comedies to get away from that crap for # short hours ,6
en,1117674556,ok i have to say although i generally enjoy british comedy i am not the biggest hugh grant fan and was not expecting that much from this film however i found myself really laughing at bits of this movie if you have a free evening its definately worth a peek ,7
en,-1332198845,this movie is hardly the fantastic film that many people make it out to be the story line in worn out the constant changes in time and location only add to the confusion characters are undeveloped and the movie just overall falls flat of my expectations even though i consider bruce willis a good actor even he was unable to raise this movie above the level of a bad hack job ,1
en,1054281284,souping up his handmade speed racer motorbike anthony hopkins playing an aging burt munro sets about making a land speed record in the ####s this gently paced movie radiates charm throughout and picks up tension in the final race at utah bonneville salt flats hopkins seems authentic as a new zealander and the script gives him plenty of room to crack typical kiwi jokes sets have been lovingly re created and the culture clash when he comes to america comes across well given the paucity of strong elderly icons in cinema this one does well it a movie that if it does not exactly blow your socks off is one you can curl up for and enjoy with the whole family let me just get my cocoa ,7
en,-1401867705,for those who have not seen the movie yet i envy you greatly you do not know what awaits a very successfully built tension and mystery accompanied by dazzling scenes and continuous surprises just when you think you have figured it all out you realize you are on the wrong track you reach lessons you think would o not trust anyone not even your brother always consider your enemies beware of complete strangers you think be more careful before taking a road which you barely can see which you barely know about but is it really what the film says you wonder so just play the game and let it flow do not listen to what others say follow what your mind says but will you be so lucky to escape with no wounds with no regrets are you haunted by your past does history repeat itself or is it all a set up innocent or guilty i do not want to go further just sit back and enjoy do not be too quick to decide with the gloomy atmosphere increasing the number of question marks in your head great scenario immensely successful direction by fincher as always and sean penn strengthening his place among my all time favorites a ## ## for me ,10
en,-1401867705,anyone loving mysteries will love this movie the game it truly keeps you guessing until the rolling credits at the end it is the much more serious version of the same story told in the bill murray comedy movie the man who knew too little which was released at the same time #### in both a brother wants to give his brother an exciting birthday present the giving brother hires a theatrical group to secretly entertain his brother on his birthday along the way however things go horribly awry from the planned script through most of the movie the brother being entertained does not know exactly what is happening to them except in bill murray case he was told that he would be dealing with a theatrical group but winds up in a real spy story thinking all along he is still dealing with actors while in michael douglas case he does not know what is going on for sure i would watch both movies they both are quite entertaining ,6
en,-1401867705,now how do i swallow this as a pill or should we crunch it down into a liquid form whatever you do it a hard film to swallow far fetch may be the solution but you have to admire these filmmakers desperate attempt to force feed us with this plot about a rich person morality game michael douglas tries in vain to convince us that he is a cold ruthless financial head rolling in money and ego wall street all over again but his little brother conrad sean penn in another manic performance sets him up for a gift he will never forget director fincer uses his technical craft to enhance the thrills but if you are quick you will work out the ending fifteen minutes into the film ,7
en,-1401867705,i have seen this film twice while it is my least favorite of fincher i still like it rarely a dull moment if you are a fan of suspense you are in luck overall i would say the core of this tale is charles dickens a christmas carol majority of the movie is set in san francisco with a brief but cool view of the golden gate bridge by night during one of the more dramatic scenes it is unfortunate however that you realize how far fetched the whole story is by the end of the movie regardless the cast is not bad at all and the acting not too shabby after all we are talking about michael douglas and sean penn here playing brothers good score very effective moral of the story do not let your childhood crap ruin your adult life ,7
en,507607113,this is probably the baddest movie in history and when i say bad i do not mean a horrible movie i mean bad as in what the characters do in it it is actually probably the best movie of the ## it got hosed at the oscars and should have beat the french connection for best picture the only reason that it did not is because people were shocked at the movie and that it was the first film in history to be rated x malcom mcdowell does a great job playing alex delarge in this movie every character in this movie actually does do a really nice job the plot is great and very original it keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for what will be coming up next the movie is phenomenal but definitely not for everyone to see # ##,9
en,507607113,stanley kubrick has created what some may call a masterpiece and others may simply call trash with a clockwork orange personally i thought that it was a good movie but certainly only for mature audiences it was originally rated x and i honestly do not know how even the re edit that i saw got down to an r rating the movie is about a group of young hoodlums whose main sources of fun are beethoven rape and murder after drinking some apparently drug laced milk at a milk bar the four men go out for a bit of the ultra violence as they put it as they beat an old bum and rape a few women after one particular altercation where he had to break into a home he usually knocks on the door saying that his friend was in a horrible car accident and gains entrance that way he kills a woman with a statue of a penis yes you read correctly and as he tries to escape from the police his friends and fellow gang members break a bottle off of his head and take off leaving him there to be caught he is taken to jail but learns of a new experimental treatment that will release him from jail sooner and also cure him of his addiction to murder and rape he goes through the procedure i wont give away details but it certainly is not for the faint of heart and is released from prison after getting kicked out of his parents house he wonders the streets until he finds a house that will let him in and let just say that he has seen the house owner before i am not going to give away any more of the movie that is for you to watch and find out overall i gave this movie a # ## it is a very good movie but only if you like this type of movie and can stomach the ultra violence blatant nudity and other adult themes some of the best parts of the movie are just listening to their slang some of it is hilarious ,9
en,507607113,surely a clockwork orange has to be one of the most twisted and disturbing films to reach any sort of mainstream popularity as is perhaps symbolized by the first frames of the opening titles which are soaking in a blood red colour then turning to blue it follows alex delarge transition from brutal crook to cured model citizen and back again with clockwork stanley kubrick builds an incredibly visually rich dystopia where every other shot seems to have fascistic religious or some other allusions hidden somewhere in the screen some have complained that kubrick is hitting the viewer over the head with his message with a giant porcelain penis if you will but i think there are some subtleties hidden beneath the highly stylized and over the top surface like with all the talk about whether or not a man without moral choice is a man at all and how after being fed with ultra violence for the first hour the first thing that genuinely disturbs me is when the authorities abuse alex there is something deeply unsettling about the scene where alex is being assaulted on stage to the enthusiastic applause of important government figures more so than when a woman is being raped on stage in front of the viewers of the film for some reason apart from the compositions the film has the great direction that can be expected from kubrick is also has great music apart from classic pieces by ludwig van and songs like singin in the rain which are often used as contrasts to great effect the main theme is truly hypnotic maybe with the exception of the surreal and sexually charged eyes with shut it feels like a clockwork orange stands out a bit from kubrick filmography due to the unrestrained style and violent nature however it still feels decidedly kubrickian by being almost as visionary as #### and as frightening as the shining ,9
en,507607113,young alex delarge malcolm macdowell rapes murders and listens to beethoven when his gang turns against him he is caught by the police and sent to prison from there he undergoes a treatment to cure his violent urges will it work casting i think the cast was perfect and this is malcolm macdowell most recognizable role watching clockwork orange tends to lead to the debate of what is kubrick best film as he has made so many classics many would say #### but this film puts up a good fight but you really never hear people debate their favorite malcolm film role because it invariably going to be this one i think imagery kubrick uses vibrant colors and some odd images the milk bar is especially unusual and sexual imagery appears all over in even the most ordinary of places the cat house a sign that says home very unusual stuff the strong christ imagery intense from my recollection of the book it was never this extreme and we have kubrick to thank for such a radical interpretation of futuristic england music obviously beethoven #th plays a key role in this and it worked in well but also the synthesized music fits such as in the record store i do not know if it makes you think of the future but it certainly makes you think this is a very foreign place from the world we know today yet the lessons and morals here are just as important some discussions could be attached to this film is it right to limit a man choices even if the choices eliminated are bad in real life is it okay to chemically castrate rapists rather than have them make their own choices is human nature defined by free choice or are we predisposed there is lots of room for discussion of these and other topics if you have not seen this see it i do not recall anyone ever leaving this film unchanged it tends to be more easily accepted by men than women for some reason and i have been hesitant to recommend it to women some have said they do not get it and others cannot get past the rape scene which is disturbing but serves to drive the point home but then again i had a female professor who had us read the book i had already read it at that point so who knows really this film is the very definition of morality freedom and the nihilistic future we are heading towards ,10
en,507607113,the movie goes on strong in all of its scenes and sequences from the quirky and mysterious opening to the utterly crazy first chapter of the story to the explicit depiction of forced brainwashing to the full circle final chapter and the conspiracy theory ending the movie is a great work for me because it can make me feel two different types of attitude towards alex at first i was utterly disgusted by what he and his gang do in their spare time on the first chapter but then when the full circle revenge is exacted by the cripple i was kind of sorry for him to have endured such atrocities but then the feeling return back to normal when the conversation with the psychiatrist happens the acting is okay in overall it shows just he kind of standard stanley kubrick work which also sometimes allow a bit of hyperbolic over acting here and there ,7
en,1431522379,the third and final instalment of christopher nolan jonathon nolan and david s goyer legendary trilogy is my least favourite but is by no means bad the problem i have found with the dark knight rises is its loss of realism batman begins the first instalment was extremely realistic and somehow still faithful to the comics that was what made the film so amazing in my opinion the dark knight loses the realism and the faithfulness to a degree but that was not a bad thing the tension story ideas and genuinely scary villains of the second instalment made it not just better than the first instalment but possibly better than any other superhero film ever made the conclusion to this nigh perfect trilogy does not come close to the first two but still satisfies the realism possibly the best thing about this trilogy is gone there is more than one scene or concept where you may think well that just plain stupid on realism it could have been much better you will know what scenes and concepts i am speaking of when you see them is this film faithful to the comics no it even less faithful than the dark knight but this is not necessarily a bad thing it means even fans of the comics are in for big nolan twists i believe that it is faithful enough for most fans to enjoy it but much less faithful than the two previous films the writing of this film is much like the last two it very nolan intelligent but somewhat confusing i think the problem with this instalment is that the writers tried too hard to make it the biggest and the best this is part of the reason the film fails to live up to the previous two the writing is certainly the worst of the three films but is definitely not bad writing it still seems dark and mysterious i think they relied too much on shocks and scary villain scenes than on adding tension and genuinely terrifying slow scenes the joker had many of these scenes in the previous film seeming unpredictable and adding tension due to no more joker the humour is gone this was necessary but takes away some enjoyment for me the directing of this film is much like the previous two nolan uses the same style throughout all three instalments the directing again takes away realism with the action not being realistic i believe that if the age certificate was bumped up they could have made the film much more terrifying and realistic the action in the film goes back to relying on fighting usually like in batman begins not tension like the dark knight however there are still tense scenes with bane tom hardy that match some of the previous film joker scenes the shots and action scenes are fantastically done like the previous two but as i have said tim burton gothic look is more preferable to me the characters in this are amazing hardly any of them seem like their comic book selves but this can be great adding a fresh unique feeling to the film joseph gordon levitt is brilliant as blake who i do believe adds to the film unlike others i also loved the controversial twist with blake if it were done any other way it would probably take away the darker side to the film the way it was done was very unique and interesting i loved cillian murphy cameo as scarecrow again i always love some cillian murphy in a film and his rather insane scarecrow adds a lot in my opinion christian bale plays a brilliant batman bruce wayne yet again i love the dark edge to his character rough voice he uses as batman tom hardy was terrifying as bane he is the opposite of the joker thinking out a large scale plan and being calmly menacing very different to the comic book bane in lots of ways but i do enjoy different takes on characters instead of the same thing in each remake anne hathaway played an interesting selina kyle she does not seem to be into the alter ego thing i do not think anyone calls her catwoman throughout the entire film her settling down with bruce wayne does not appeal to me as it is not in character enough james newton howard and hans zimmer did an excellent job with the music yet again all of the tracks are unique and are great additions the soundtrack is very different to the previous films the first two instalments use dragged out slow music to create tension most of the time this film does that but to a much lesser degree what i loved about the series music in the first two was the tense slow metallic music that suits batman and is not like the usual exciting blasting music this music while unique is exciting and blasting usually it takes the tension away again which is one of the best things about this trilogy as a standalone soundtrack i absolutely love this but as a part of this trilogy i am not too fund of it i much prefer the tense slow tracks overall i believe that this is a brilliant last instalment of a genius trilogy i loved most of it it is very different from the previous two which is both good and bad it felt very exciting and tense at times and the overall story is excellent if unrealistic it is an amazing film but is not close to as good as the previous two i find it surprising that this ranks higher than batman begins on the top ### films this finale does not disappoint it is a genius conclusion for a genius trilogy it not as good as the other two instalments but beating them would be an absolutely huge achievement i expected a brilliant film to conclude the series and that what i got could not be happier ,9
en,1431522379,to begin i was not a huge fan of nolan batman films i watched the dark knight first in theaters four years ago and i did not think it was that impressive except for heath ledger legendary performance as the joker then i watched batman begins for the sake of watching the whole trilogy before this film came out and it was just as dull as the dark knight so as you can tell i was not really hyped for this film but boy did this film change my opinion on the nolan trilogy despite the film being slightly longer than the dark knight it kept me on the edge of my seat the visuals were great the action sequences were great and the characters were interesting batman bruce wayne in particular was more interesting than the previous two films because he is at the lowest point of his life he secluded and antagonized by the public his abilities as the charismatic billionaire and batman has diminished because of the previous events in the dark knight his internal and external struggle is strongly portrayed by bale bane was another interesting villain who possessed the same level of intimidation and charisma as ledger joker anne hathaway catwoman was not memorable as michelle pfeiffer in batman returns but was way more interesting than harvey dent or even maggie gyllenhhal rachel from the dark knight other supporting casts such as gary oldman and michael caine gave solid performances the story certainly had more of the essence of batman begins than the dark knight but definitely tied the trilogy together very nicely the drama was not draggy and overdone like the dark knight in the end the dark knight rises firmly establishes nolan batman trilogy and as a solid addition to the batman film franchise since tim burton batman ,10
en,1431522379,the dark knight rises was my favorite film of the year and from the dark knight trilogy i was looking forward to this movie and it did not disappoint me positive epic action scenes great acting performances very good villain emotional ending inspiring movie negative some plot wholes that did not affect me overall the movie was fantastic and i think that it is the one of the best movies ever made long live the batman eight years on a new evil rises from where the batman and commissioner gordon tried to bury it causing the batman to resurface and fight to protect gotham city the very city which brands him an enemy,10
en,1431522379,people people please stop with this movie was so awesome oh i have to believe this movie was so good and i have to repeat it because of the tragedy associated with it it was not that good period my bottom line for critiquing a movie is entertainment value when i see a movie i want to be entertained i do not want to be preached too i do not want political messages sandwiched and purposely slid into the creases of the movie i do not want to be made to feel guilty about the environment or some filmmakers or the hollywood types personal agenda so based solely on the entertainment factor i was disappointed the first problem i had was with bain really was this guy kicked in the nuts what was the deal with his vienna boys choir voice whenever he talked i half expected him to break out into a monologue of shakespeare a villain should have some fear factor it was so bad i was pre occupied with thoughts of what pro wrestler did they hire to play this guy and who voice did they use to dub over this goon and why does not it match up make me afraid of this guy secondly the special effects were sad when the highlights of the special effects are the motorcycle turning ## degrees and having the wheels flip over really usually excellent special effects can hide some deficiencies in story and plot was i missing something next there were excellent actors but they had nothing to work with lets do ### really quick scenes and not spend any time exploring anything lets spend all the plot capital on bain and bruce trying to climb out of a hole and then have the the men in the bottom of the hole chant rise rise rise rise how genius now we can title the movie the dark night rises oh awesome that makes me all warm and fuzzy inside the title makes so much sense now lets also write a really bland part for robin and have him become the scout leader or some kind of weird babysitter for the orphan boys cannot wait for the next installment with creepy and other than masculine robin the gal that played catwoman did not work for me could not take my eyes off her freaky collarbone that the pearl necklace perched eerily on i think i could stack books on that thing obviously four years was long enough for nolan to lose what ever magic he had early on in this trilogy i guess when the first one was so awesome it inevitable that it going downhill from there i was not entertained comparative to the amount of money spent save yourself twenty bucks and wait for it on dvd you can put a label on a pile of pooh and call it batman whatever but it still a pile of pooh unless you drank the oh there was a tragedy so that immediately makes this movie awesome kool aide the real tragedy is that i saw this movie on purpose ,3
en,796365900,as i have said in my several other comments that i have been looking for movies that did not try to make a suspense action thriller with a twisted ending and fail horribly at the ending all i wanted was an action movie that had almost no plot but the acting and the dialogs would keep me sitting tight in position this movie was it even though i admit it is a fairly old movie it still has its explosive charms and witty comeback lines which makes this movie one of my friday night favorites i have permanently added the word insignificunt into my repertoire as a result good fun movie and for that reason alone it gets a # however it only gets a # because it is nothing but a fun flick that should not be mistaken for a thrilling and meaningful masterpiece ,6
en,1970697805, american history x is nowadays almost a cult movie one of the category that seems to get better with the time this is probably because of the very actual message and the strong story of a family caught in the racial and gangs conflicts of the ##s los angeles the messages that hate does not solve problems and that tentatives to reconcile cannot wipe overnight deep rooted problems are still strong and universal and the movie looks as actual as the day it hit the screens it is also the best movie of edward norton in the principal role of the pro nazi gang leader who kills two afro american who were trying to stole his car he is shown the day of his liberation trying to re build his life and wipe over his violent past but meantime he became a model for the racial hate groups in the neighborhood and for his younger brother if there is hope beyond the violent conflict it in the tentative of some of the characters to bring some sanity but the message is open and the tragic end avoids the typical rose water endings of the hollywood movies i liked this film it talked to me length about race conflict hate appeasing forgiveness as i said it more actual than ever # out of ## on my personal scale ,9
en,1970697805,i believe that he is already but this should be made edward norton a superstar i think the movie is a bit flawed the ending was shocking but did not make all that much sense to me for those who have seen it i just do not get fully why it was done but norton character carried the entire movie i recommend this movie to everyone fight club was cool and it is also really good but damn this kid could do anything watch him here then watch death to smoochy it hard to believe that it the same actor it sucks that good roles only go to cruise pitt and hanks all the time i am not knocking them at all but hollywood should give norton more of a chance he definitely deserved it after this flick ,9
en,851622481,it rare that a walt disney animation studios film is considered better than a pixar film but this is such an example it almost like disney answer to scott pilgrim in terms of how it uses video games but a great story and cast prevents this from being a copy of said film john c reilly voices wreck it ralph a villain of a # bit video game where he gets no respect for his role since the hero of the game fix it felix jr jack mcbrayer gets all the glory when a new first person shooter game named hero duty arrives ralph sees this as an opportunity to prove himself as a hero but in the process he ends up causing a catastrophe that could mean game over for the arcade while gamers will love the various audio and visual gags in this film the story and characters including sarah silverman as vanellope von schweetz really shine one of my favourite things about this film is the interactions between felix and sergeant calhoun jane lynch they were brilliant together in the end this is a highly entertaining movie and one i truly recommend to see gamer or not ,9
en,-332087214,after hearing all of the hype surrounding this film my expectations were set rather high but after i finally sat down and watched this film i was kind of let down while this film was a bit of a let down it was still somewhat interesting to watch this film had great acting from both the main and supporting actors who really seemed to give it there all to portray these characters perfectly but that was the only part of this movie that really blew me away the plot was somewhat interesting but moved a little to slow in my opinion overall this film is way over hyped and in my opinion should not be considered on of the best films ever made ,10
en,-667195821,highly recommended movie it shows the story via a monologue with the main actor nicolas cage it also gives very unique and inspiring perspective into the world of arms dealing while in same time showing interesting conflicts the characters have and how they cope or do not cope with them while being serious movie as godfather it has some comic scenes as well which only adds to the movie while managing to keep the overall feeling real and serious buttom line if you like movies such as godfather casino you are guaranteed to like this one as well enjoy ,10
en,-667195821,this film is rather hard to classify is it a black comedy a pseudo documentary a war film a drama that studies a really cold blooded character who does what he does because he does it best i finally settled on mockumentary yet nicholas cage pulls it off he is the most cold blooded sob one can imagine the combination to the container filled with weapons to kill thousands is the birth date of his son in the end his brother rebels while they deliver arms after he sees soldiers hack a woman and child to death with machetes when the soldiers negotiating the arms deal mow cage brother down with machine guns cage continues negotiating why get himself killed too it hard to imagine someone like that can exist but after all cage is just a bigger version of the machete wielders and according to the film just poppycocks compared to the presidents of the us russia france etc who deal in arms and destruction on a yet greater scale indeed at the end of the film just like these leaders of entire countries cage is too big to fail he laughs in the face of the justice department agent who captured him with solid evidence in hand and wants to put cage behind bars for good cage explains to him with a smile what is really going to happen once he leaves the room and so it does at which point we return to cage as the narrator full circle with the beginning of the film except now we get to see what makes the crunching sound under his shoes millions of bullets just like the one that we followed from manufacture to the skull of a child in the opening credits the film certainly preaches but in a way so absurd matter of fact and darkly comedic that it does not appear heavy handed merely unbelievable and yet we know all too well that the events we see in the film the useless maiming and killing of millions happened and the arms to do the deed did come from somewhere the film sometimes descends into mocking itself at other times the pieces fall into place too conveniently so it remains merely very good but well worth watching even if you are not into conspiracy theories ,6
en,619717208,do not let the fact that hacksaw ridge is about a pacifist fool you it just as graphically violent as you would expect from a war movie directed by gibson the revenant set a new standard with its opening war scene hacksaw ridge does not come close to it sure it violent but it also difficult to follow so much attention is paid to all the different ways the human body can be destroyed by wwii era weaponry that you forget you are supposed to care about the individual lives being lost some of these scenes are so gruesome they approach ridiculousness such as a soldier picking up the torso of a comrade his arms and legs having been blown off and running into battle using him as a meat shield did i mention this movie is about a pacifist it does not exactly come to the fore but then none of the characters do it just blood guts explosions death mayhem it almost makes you grateful the real desmond doss whose story this is based on did not live to see this movie ,6

en,118508639,i was very excited to see this film and in the end i was quite pleased but kind of let down by how little action took place throughout the # hour run time the movie is based on a linguist is hired to decipher an alien language to find out why there here to those of you who still have not seen the movie i would stop reading because then what will follow will spoil the entirety of the movie throughout the movie there are several hints of how the flashbacks shown in the beginning of the movie are actually things that would happen in the future after the aliens had already arrived the sense of how time was not linear when reading the aliens language was quite confusing but really did make the film quite unique as a sci fi for me what stunned me were the amazing visual effects of the creepy octopus like aliens and also the space ships what still amazes me after watching it is how the aliens ships dissipates in the clouds at the end of the film what let me down though was the lack of action throughout the entire movie i was anticipating some action but in the end i was left kind of bored from the trailer i did expect some action such as the explosion and the helicopters firing at the ship but in the end there was close to # action so if you cant stand watching films without action i would not recommend the only sort of action within the #h was an explosion which lasted about # seconds brief summary for those who skim read the idea behind time and how reading the aliens language makes a person perceive it as a non linear variable the visual effects are stunning and do satisfy sci fi fans such as myself flashbacks are heartfelt and bring together the pieces that left many baffled throughout the film well acted lack of action,8
en,118508639,everything except tricking the dumb audience with some emotional stuff to come out and watch this nonsense worst movie of #### its the same people who liked gravity kind of bad movies all they did was put some emotional things and rest of it was such a load of stuff a # yr old could do a better drawing of aliens than this there was nothing about science fiction the space ship was such a horrible job terrible background music these people are stealing from your pockets with this crap please do not watch i felt like # # hours of my life are gone and are never coming back rotten tomatoes has good rating i cant believe how these many people can like such nonsense i mean these days all they have to do is put some absolute unrelated emotional crap and people with it what did her kid with cancer have to do with anything why even bring that up ,1
en,118508639,arrival is science fiction cinema for women the film shifts science fiction cinema preoccupation with re enacting colonial conflict and discovery as a violent penetrative act that scars what it explores malcolm jurassic park to a relationship drama played out between linguistics expert dr louise banks amy adams and physicist ian donnelly jeremy renner arrival refers to the appearance of twelve enigmatic alien spaceships on earth and to the yet to be born the birth of banks and donnelly baby girl who we see as an infant and as a young adult in the film opening moments as memories of a life that has not yet occurred unfold for banks so does her ability to understand the aliens purpose in visiting the earth so independence day this is not thank goodness arrival is instead a wistful dreamlike exploration of the meaning of human suffering at the same time it explores the way reality is gendered by culture and the categories by which we perceive reality differences between masculinity and femininity are sometimes expressed in the opposition between hard and oft on the science fiction literary scene hard or even radically hard sf is characterized by its focus on engineering the physical sciences and humanity as little more than meat in contrast arrival knowingly foregrounds the soft humanistic science of linguistics communication and emotion the hard sciences are represented by donnelly a physicist but sf cinema masculine focus on war conflict and destruction is relegated to a threatening backdrop against which bank and donnelly relationship and bank attempts to communicate with aliens are played out in place of quantum physics the film explicitly references socio linguistics and in particular the apir whorf hypothesis that language shapes or even determines our perception of reality as an aside it was sapir student benjamin lee whorf who was responsible in an article cience and linguistics for spreading the academic urban legend that eskimos have anything from four to a thousand words for snow whorf main legacy is a linguistic relativism that posits language determines perceptions whether that be perceptions of the alien here the film utilizes the time honored convention of representing the alien other as a kind of squid or of men and women in a culture where gender difference is a fundamental way of categorizing the world time itself can be gendered masculine time is characteristically linear goal directed and enacted in the public sphere feminine time is cyclical marked by repetition and enacted in the domestic sphere fundamentally feminine time is organized around child birth and child care while this will strike some ears as over generalized and prejudicial what way time should be spent forms part of the core of sexism and racism in for example women experience of employment whorf himself used a study of the hopi to exemplify the way conceptions of time can be culturally relativistic he contentiously argued that the hopi have no concept of time and that the western concept of time as flowing smoothly from the past to the present is culturally specific in arrival the aliens work with a cyclical feminine conception of time the cyclical way the aliens live in time is represent by the aliens language which consists of circles of ink and by the name bank gives her child hannah a palindrome that can be read forwards and backwards the aliens purpose on earth is reciprocal they are here to help us so that in three thousand years we can help them or should that be we have helped them so they would help us as bank learn the aliens language so her experience of time changes and past and present become one here family memories turn out to be memories of the future if we cling to the model of linear time while arrival seems to challenge confining stereotypes of cinema science fiction appearances can be deceiving my first disappointment was that the film argues that only by working together can humanity secure a better future but despite the appeal to the chinese mark place the script balks at collectivism and returns to an all too familiar appeal to one man making a difference or in this case one woman with the help and protection of a couple of men but more troubling there seemed something insidious about the film world view it does address an audience of women and it does place as center stage much of what the sci fi genre leaves behind and cultural feminists have argued that what liberal feminists see as discriminatory stereotypes are actually real lived differences between men and women that are to be honored and valued by advocating acceptance of the inevitability of life and death the absolute already determined past and present the film also feels like it is advocating acceptance of the way things are including gender difference no room for protesting here or for radical rethinking the nature of gender what will be will be what is is the birth and death are for women to celebrate and mournfully embrace arrival and the sapir whorf hypothesis around which it is built encourage predetermination the result replicated in this review is a conflation of linguistic categories with lived experience whether positively or negatively valued those categories of masculinity and femininity are constraining there no place in arrival world of the inevitable for the collective action of women now demonstrating on america streets against male determination of their bodies and their future what is needed at times of change is another more open construction of time in which time arrow and cyclical time are both replaced and remade as something new now is again the time for less acceptance of suffering and more embracing of suffrage ,4
en,118508639,what would happen if an alien race visited earth artists and authors have been answering this question for over a century bringing different perspectives to the issue while the portrayal of hostile extraterrestrials attacking the earth is certainly popular there is a place in science fiction for stories of diplomatic visits exploring how other civilizations may interact with ours and how humanity deals with changes on this level when large spacecrafts land around the world colonel gt weller forest whitaker brings in linguist louise banks amy adams to assist in translating the aliens words and writing together with physicist ian donnelly jeremy renner louise works to communicate with the heptapod aliens while at the same time she is haunted by flashes of her daughter life and early death as tensions build and the threat of global war grows louise must find out why the aliens have come and what their visit means for humanity i find that one of the film strengths is its portrayal of how people around the globe react to the heptapods arrival we see people rioting a radio personality calling for violence against the aliens governments reacting through paranoia and more in its purest sense arrival is a movie about people that also features aliens it uses their arrival as a backdrop for a story about people in more ways than you could ever expect when walking into it arrival is a rare film that can balance ideas and emotions in such a way that neither overpowers the other and both can be integral to the film character this is without a doubt one of the finest science fiction films of the last few years if not the past decade and i have personally recommended it to just about anyone who will listen to me ,9
en,42881120,i must have watched the wrong movie the reviews for this film could in no way apply to the contrived claptrap i have just seen perhaps the positive reviews here were intended for that #### masterpiece house of whipcord the movie called whiplash that i saw stars j k simmons as terence a music teacher who can slap a face with such force as to make general patton wince the film also stars miles teller as andrew a student of terence who yearns to learn from him how to properly play the drums andrew accomplishes this by volunteering to let his teacher play the bongos on his face i wo not say that damien chazelle direction is heavy handed but i would probably prefer to stick my head in andrew bass drum during the climactic scene than to endure watching said scene again a word of advice to anyone considering seeing this film go to youtube instead and do a search for buddy rich you will see the greatest drummer ever and spare yourself the agony of viewing this over the top trite clich d eye roll inducing effort your eyes and your ears will thank you for it ,10
en,42881120,damien chazelle the writer director of whiplash is a harvard graduate if you keep in mind this trivia while watching the movie things can be explained better representing his directorial debut he chose to create a film where the notion that getting good at something having a career conquer the greatest skill is what counts most in life it counts more than human interactions and socializing friends and family more than life itself this is the message he felt like sharing with us in his first feature such a wrong life meaning can only be shown via a questionable and improbable sequence of shots in other words what this movie basically is all in all the movie fails strictly and only because of the story i can overlook all other parts but not the ludicrous story chosen to be presented first of it is an ugly story i have never seen a film depicting rise to greatness in an uglier manner unless some film about hitler perhaps and even if i skip its ugliness we do not really see that much stuff about anything the plot says its about the relationship between teacher student what relationship there was no depth and progress development of some kind at all human interactions shown in the film some started to build but then they stopped i thought how karate kid the original showed in a beautiful way a relationship of teacher student and boy likes girl expect no such development quality in whiplash there is no depth in this film its all in your face the same sentence over and over i want greatness as far as the music goes do not expect learning much about music through this supposedly film about a jazz drummer i cant recall a single soundtrack and no music information but for some quick words on buddy rich one of the greatest jazz drummers we see no relationship of any kind family girl friends and even the teacher there are just a few scenes nothing that would remotely be adequate to show a nice progression for us the viewers to get involved and feel for the characters the teacher character as mentioned in other comments suits more as an army general but even then he would be unrealistic and just wrong the guy is just mean beyond reality it is mind blowing that the people involved even allowed such a character in this kind of film the miles teller character is okay in many ways but for the vital one that he chooses the superficial greatness over life which is throughout the movie the only topic adequately shown at first i was waiting for the movie to get somewhere it did start good i wanted steady development i wanted the character to learn to share to give to others his views get better in life some good moral you know chazelle did not feel for a good moral though he felt like introducing to us meaningless superficial characters that never learn that would be okay if the ultimate film point was that this is a wrong path as any person with his head on his shoulders would think but no instead we get a savage film of selfishness and sadism and that this is the road to take there is no turn no twist in this part you can tell the direction comes from a guy who just started making films too many steady shots the acting is alright nothing great just fine though i do hope that the one guy who learns something about life is the director writer of this film not the viewers ,5
en,1664867938,just as with other of nolan flicks this is as pretentious and filled with nonsense how can anyone believe that travelling through a black hole will be as simple as walking though a park even the visuals were t that great just look at some hubble pics for pete sake the story line was weak unbelievable this movie made a mockery out of everything scientific it is sci fi at its worst did anyone notice how this movie was a hack of twister tars collected the data like how the mini transmitter things were let go in a twister to transmit data i find it really disturbing so many people think this movie is close to perfect i was shifting in my seat anxiously waiting for the end this piece of bs is not worth the time and money close to # hours of my life i will never get that back thanks ,1
en,1664867938,this awkward movie felt like sci fi produced by a technical corporate entity the idea was fairly cute much depended on the mourning by the daughter but the actress did not make me care about her the protagonist did not make me care about him either for that matter i thought the female astronaut was quite engaging but the movie was the most interesting her choices angst and suffering were the only interesting thing about the movie the black hole stuff was horrible but even the black hole in this movie is not volume enough for the plot holes and miraculous coincidences that drive the story he was only able to communicate via a malfunctioning watch what the nothing in this movie made sense every major scene was blatantly impossible worst of all there was no warmth no compassion no style no love ,4
en,1664867938,i have always liked science fiction movies and this one is pretty good nice acting as would be expected from accomplished actors like matthew mcconaughey anne hathaway jessica chastain john lithgow and many others great visuals great score and a partially good use of the science involved especially general relativity we can pass on the wormhole a totally theoretical gravitational phenomenon but they completely ignored tidal gravity meaning in an intensely strong gravitational field such as near a black hole event horizon or crossing it the force is so strong that it will pull the nearer side of an object much more than the far side thus tearing it apart down to the atomic level well before reaching the event horizon i am sure that this was glossed over because it would be fatal to the plot but it is still a pretty good movie ,7
en,1664867938,christopher nolan has a reputation of psychologically deep convoluted and complex thrillers ie inception memento etc and interstellar is no exception interstellar takes place in a dystopian future in which the human race has lost the majority of it resources and must rely on farming for food as the earth is slowly dying and the human race is coming to an end a group of people set out through a wormhole to find a new planet for humans to live on to say anymore than that would be a spoiler and it is best to go into this movie knowing as little as possible interstellar is a movie that gradually changes in tone and style as it goes on the first act is very intriguing and leaves you interested in finding out where the movie is going it does a good job establishing the dystopia and what it is like for the people on earth there is also an underlying theme of human drama mostly between a father and his children the second act takes a drastic turn and becomes a sci fi adventure with an abstract feel to it there is suspense thrills great visuals and special effects and an overall very good story that sucks you in the third and final act of the movie takes an unexpected twist and is one of the most interesting and original things i have ever seen in a movie interstellar has a very strong cast there are great performances from matthew mcconaughey anne hathaway michael caine and the rest of the cast as well there is also a great use of music that helps to build the tension interstellar is not perfect the main flaw being that it is slightly too long i found the second act and part of the third act to drag on and become too drawn out i also felt that there were too many story elements happening at once and it became overly bloated at times rather than sticking to the story i was interested in in conclusion although slightly too long and bloated interstellar is a great psychological thriller that will leave you thinking about it long after the credits roll i look forward to seeing it again ,8
en,1664867938,and heaps of it enough to keep you firmly glued to your seat for # full hours not an easy task in times where people barely have the attention span to read their own name yes matthew mcconaughey delivered a stellar performance and the story sparkled to the last minute without turning stale can you say the same about your beer from the first minute the movie effortlessly takes you inside and ties even the most far out concepts into a clever storyline the visuals pleasure the eyeball and even though no one has ever seen space time bend itself around a black hole the voyage never turns into a bad lsd trip or a whack video clip from the early ##ies fasten seat belts spoilers ahead one of the few things that made me frown a little was the cornfield set ablaze by murph to lure the brother out of the house so she could ponder her bookshelf in peace decipher the morse code and save the planet i mean it seems a bit much to destroy the last food on earth just to have the house to yourself also at times the music was too loud for my sensitive human eardrums but other than that an incredible experience with hints of dry humor marinated in human warmth possibly one of the best scifi movies for years to come,9

en,1664867938,nolan has once again outdone himself i do not have enough adjectives to describe this movie it ineffable it pure class exquisite mathew has done his best and hans zimmer another best perfect and possibly the best sci fi flick of the millennium no one has explained about time travel so far but we got nolan here why worry he has explained in his typical way brilliance all the way love you sir chris nolan michael caine anne hathaway and jessica chastain all rocked very well too as nolan said watch the movie at least twice in theatres once the bluray comes we shall own the movie ,10
en,1664867938,interstellar started off as geek porn then it became confusing then it left you staring at credits wondering what the heck christopher nolan just had you watch i was mad at first i was mad that christopher nolan ruined what could have been one of the greatest films of the year i thought that nolan idea of interstellar space travel could have made the next star wars but it did not and i am glad instead nolan made a movie that tried to explain the unexplainable it tried to explain black holes world with more than three dimensions and so much more while at the same time having a beautiful plot that aims to get the theme across that love transcends time and space but it did not at first walking out of that movie theater i was mad mad because i was confused i did not understand the bigger picture yet i only started to understand it when i got back home and i just thought about it and i am not sure i quite understand all of it when i am writing this review right now but the best movies are the ones that make you think and i think that i will be thinking about this movie for weeks months because i am not sure that i will ever be able to look at a movie the same way again after watching interstellar for a movie that is so complex it gets a simple point across and to understand that simple point you just have to look past the fact that you may be confused about some of the subjects in the movie you have a whole lifetime to learn about them you just have to look at the bigger picture ,10

en,1706369131,stand by me is a great film it has received a ## on rotten tomatoes # # on imdb and praises from many people it is a quiet little film that evokes wonder through marvelous plot twists humor inside fascinating characters and mystery in deepening pools of trouble the director of the film rob reiner created a perfect film to go along with stephen king novel the body the book came out in #### and the movie came out four years later in #### but this legendary film still captures the hearts of many today aside from being compared to other big hitters such as the outsiders the lost boys goonies and many more it stands out as it own beautiful film in this captivating movie four best friends set out to find the body of a dead boy they dodge trains walk through leech filled marshes argue with a junk yard man and tumble with a rowdy gang who want to find the body for themselves the gang is filled with some older brothers of the four boys and ace the meanest of the group their big battle for the grand prize all started because of chubby noisy and hysterical vern vern jerry o connell is looking for his lost coins under the porch when his older brother and one of the gang members walk up the porch steps and start talking about where the body of ray brower aka dead boy is vern listens and eventually escapes from the porch and runs to tell his friends in their fort after hearing the story they decide to start their journey across the train tracks that night for one person in this story gordie lachance wil wheaton this is not just another adventure it personal ever since his older brother denny john cusack died gordie parents have not been the same and he thinks it because they had to see their dead son gordie will do anything he can to try and understand what happened and he will stop at nothing to see the deceased ray brower just like gordie wo not stop until he see a dead body rob reiner wo not stop until he creates a masterpiece even though this movie is based on a book rob put his own spin on things for example in the book gordie and teddy corey feldman fight about trying to dodge a train but in the movie it chris river phoenix who fights with him in the book gordie has a vision of his older brother denny telling him that he should be in the casket instead of him while in the movie gordie has a dream of his father marshall bell telling him he should be dead instead of denny these are very minor changes that do not affect the plot overall rob did a great job of following the book this movie is about overcoming obstacles and evolving friendship this can be shown in a multiple number of scenes an example of this is when they find the body and talk about what to do next while they are discussing this the older boys show up and torment them ace pulls a knife and threatens to hurt all the boys if they did not give ace and the gang credit for finding the body ace grabs chris and puts the knife to his throat at this point chris big brother eyeball chambers bradley gregg starts trying to get ace to stop while this is going on gordie grabs a hidden gun that chris stashed in his sleeping bag and fires it straight up in the air he tells ace to let him go and to leave ace then challenges him by saying what are you going to do shoot us all so gordie cocks the gun and says no ace just you that is enough to make ace stand down and leave with the rest of the gang the boys then decide to place an anonymous tip to the police they all stuck together and overcame the biggest obstacle they had faced unfortunately all good things must come to an end it happens sometimes friends come in and out of our lives like busboys in a restaurant just like this movie eventually had to end so did the friendships in the end gordie reveals how all of these friendships ended up whether it was naturally growing apart or being ripped away by things we cannot control gordie tells us that throughout the years vern and teddy grew apart from chris and gordie they would say hello in the hallways but other than that they became a person in a sea of people vern went on to be quite successful in life but unfortunately teddy did the opposite he got rejected by the military because of his terrible eyesight and started working odd jobs around town chris and gordie stayed good friends throughout life but their marvelous friendship ended tragically chris was at a fast food restaurant when one of the men in line pulled a knife on another chris tried to make peace between the two men but he ended up taking one to the jugular and died on the spot gordie grew up to be a writer with a family rob ends the movie perfectly by having gordie at the computer writing out i never had any friends later on like the ones i had when i was twelve jesus does anyone overall this is a great movie with a fantastic message the director does an amazing job and the acting is superb i would recommend this movie to everyone whether you are into action drama or heartbreak this

en,1706369131,this movie has such a punch a group of boys culled from some of the best child actors of the time make a gruesome discovery how they handle it will affect them their whole lives but the story is as much about their pasts and their connection to one another i just wrote comments on the breakfast club i felt that movie lacked chemistry while every type was represented it just did not cook the way this one does part of it is that these boys while in some ways disenfranchised are not open books as they interact their dreams and hopes are drawn from them some seem quite settled but when push comes to shove they have vulnerabilities the stories they tell give us insight into their souls from what has happened to some of the actors it makes one wonder if some of that suffering came from within them there are intense scenes there is bragging and one upsmanship along the way and nothing is simple or trite on of the best movies of our time ,10
en,216660589,how can this movie have # # it outrageous basically it a bad prequel from the lotr trilogy i gave it a # but honestly the #d was unnecessary and also bilbo such bad acting i just wanted to leave the theater one thing is for sure i will never buy a ticket for part# and # for all u lotr fans who have not seen this u better stick with the original peter jackson basically came with the same stuff from lotr and added some hungry gnoms to the mix and voila u got yourself a #d ### mil budget blockbuster at least that all i understood from this lame attempt of creating a movie the lack of originality is so obvious and only a journey down memory lane can make someone give it more than a # ,8
en,216660589,i loved this first sequel of the hobbit more than the lord of the rings fellowship of the ring despite them not being really comparable it had more of a comedic undertone to it and was so much fun it had action comedy seriousness inspiration and so much more but this time seeing someone so much set in his own ways so afraid to explore decide to take a risk for the first time and live an adventure like no other the # hours or so felt like only an hour and it left an addictive taste for more it could not have had a better cast than martin freeman and richard armitage i cannot wait to watch the desolation of smaug ,10
en,216660589,i am an old man and ai not got time left in this life to write a lot took three of my sons to see the midnight showing of this movie imax and #d paid big bucks to do so and expected a lot i have read the hobbit and lotr many many times each probably more times than some of you are old and i loved the movie i will go back a see it again i did not care that the movie strayed from the book it stayed true to the story it was entertaining it was fun and even though i only have like another thirty or so years left in my life the waiting in line for two hours sitting in the theater for an hour and half watching the funny antics of all the kids btw of the over ### people in the theater i was the oldest by ## years # hours watching the movie half hour looking for my car forgot where we parked and two hours of total driving it was time very well spent and used frodo lives ,10
en,216660589,its based on the hobbing but the film is good peter jackson finally proved he can make all movie for any child romantic and really politically correct so once again two cheers to the director peter jackson go watch this with all family and kids because this film is for them is for they r kinda age and its basically not bad the last film from peter jackson the lovely bones had sent shivers down my spine and made me think that this company had finally run itself into the ground result was that it was a massive flop but with this one i have managed to regain some faith in the films that jackson is now releasing it is a great family movie good for the holiday season and some people might even need a hankie but take it for what it is a fun movie enjoyable with the nerd set peter jackson the director follows his own passion of influences despite strong objections from the actual tolkien estate what the hobbit an unexpected journey could have done without are certain inappropriate extra characters not found in the original tale bringing to mind instead george lucas phantom menace also the film overstays its welcome when it drudges on for a good ## minutes after the dwarfs have resolved their issues with bilbo the romantic track between certain humans with newly added female members of their species seems obligatory at best and it does not help that gandalf and baggins have zero chemistry together i think this was deliberately done by jackson camp the weakest section of the movie is its music by howard shore it one of the most unimpressive work from the maestro with not even a single melodious song this project needed some special children songs which were found missing special effects are uncomplicated and are not used in excess which is intelligent thinking by the director all one can say is that its an ok movie with a simple look and has nothing special to talk about something extraordinary was expected from peter jackson but sadly it was not there ,4
en,216660589,on learning that the hobbit a ### page children book was to be extended over three films unexpected journey being the first it seemed peter jackson may have been seeking a compromise between the children friendly book and the more darker and foreboding lotr trilogy unsurprisingly an unexpected journey fails to transcend the source material although it is debatable if this was jackson intention the first fifty minutes is actually the most impactful gollum appearance not too far behind there are nice homage to lotr and it provides the necessary back story most importantly it enables the twelve dwarfs to be more than a generic rabble just fighting and squabbling martin freeman starts as he ends the film playing bilbo baggins with aplomb in a fine performance providing the understated and yet determined nature of the intrepid adventurer once bilbo leaves bag end however the magic ceases the rest of the film is a number of set pieces which fail to propel the story what we have is an a to b to c without an emotional arch or purposeful plot one continues to watch an unexpected journey waiting for jackson to rein in on the needless superfluous activity but it does not happen it is at this juncture that one begins to accept rather belatedly that an unexpected journey is not the cross over adaptation that one may have hoped jackson off the map excursion with elrond galadriel gandalf and saruman only help to conflate rather than placate the elder viewer the special effects are satisfactory if not altogether an improvement on lotr unfortunately this is for me an unexpected journey biggest fault it becomes apparent through the effects that jackson has decided pardon the juxtaposition evil friendly the appearance of the great goblin and his cohorts azogand his wolves are much less menacing than lotr and have an intentional illusory and non frightening composition can one even forgive the over intrusive nature of the subtitles if more credence is needed that an unexpected journey is a more youthful creation one only need to look at the manner in which bilbo comes across gollum and the way in which the company fall into the goblin kingdom one has to suspend disbelief at the comic book survival skills of the party noticeably altered from the book too an unexpected journey does have its moments there is some fun bravado a couple of meaningful montages and some much needed pathos the acting is of the highest quality i have to conclude that an unexpected journey was intended for a younger audience and i cannot begrudge jackson for this however the three hour long running time is just unnecessary when to all intents and purposes a longer film would be more inclined to an older audience as a consequence an unexpected journey should be cut with big scissors a big disappointment and i only hope that parts two and three try to provide a more menacing and intelligent cross over ,5
en,1361284206,i stayed away from this for a long time because i am an old codger who loves the old basil rathbone nigel bruce sherlock holmes movies and from the trailer i thought this was going to be another far out robert downey jr flick that would be more science fiction fx movie than a good holmes mystery well it was but the movie was still very entertaining and i really liked it and i would certainly watch it again yeah it was a little weird seeing holmes and watson duking it out numerous times like they were members of the expendables but once that was accepted i could settle back and enjoy the action the dialog the special effects the fascinating characters and sharp picture and visuals making it all surprisingly fun ride all the major characters in here were very entertaining and all the while holmes still retained his incredible powers of deduction which were a hoot to hear so for older people who expect a very sedate holmes and watson either skip the film or loosen up and just be ready for two hours of wild entertainment ,9
en,1812626543,first of all i do not hate this movie visuals #d effects are awesome but i do not know why everyone is constantly giving high rating to this movie the story is kind of average and there is nothing exciting about it we can guess what happens in the end the moment we watch ## ## mins of the movie also sandra bullock keeps on saying that she failed to work with spaceship simulator in the past why would nasa send such person to space i hate space dialogue was ridiculous i agree that we cant expect much from a movie whose entire storyline revolves around space but the plot was not upto the mark and you cannot judge a movie just based on its #d effects ,5
en,1812626543,well where to start gravity in my opinion is the most overrated movie of the year the special effect do not get me wrong are great if you like that sort of thing however i feel all they do is hide the mediocre script and the boring storyline my first problem is that the film feels slow and lacks the real edge to grab you off the edge of your seat some would argue that it does this however i just felt that i never really got in to the story line and why anything was actually happening clooney plays his character very well and this is one of the few areas this works well bullock on the other hand lacks any real heroism in my opinion and i feel that i never really actually cared about whether she survived or not i know this may sound harsh but if you compare gravity to apollo ## a very similar type of film then in apollo ## i actually felt connected to the characters unlike in gravity where they just seem a touch boring however i must stress this i did not aviator or life of pi for this exact same reason all in all i thought it was pretty average but i do recommend going to see it because the special effects which are first class ,6
en,1812626543,when i was a little girl i strongly remember wanting to grow up to be an astronaut i know who has not right i have been an avid watcher of as many space travel and sci fi movies and tv series as i can and i have even studied a few astrophysics and astronomy books attempted to go to college i always and even up until recently seriously dreamed of traveling to space myself before it was simply reality and chronic lifelong illnesses and disability since childhood that had kept me from it but that changed when i saw gravity upon experiencing the most immersive film i have ever been to feeling like i also was trapped in space with my palms sweating toes curling heart pounding at the speed of light and having many breathless moments it was like being on an hour long roller coaster ride through space the best #d effects i have ever seen and i am urging everyone i speak to that if you have even the slightest interest in this movie anything short of a #d cinema experience will diminish it too greatly to excuse you must go see this movie in the theater trying to watch it at home will rob you of the best thrill ride of your life upon seeing the terrors experiencing them myself through this movie i no longer wish to travel to space i feel just fine with my feet planted firmly on the ground than you at the very least i thought of nothing else while sitting in the theater and it will help you forget the insanities of our world for a short time if i could give it ### stars it would be a no brainer forget those who chose to nit pick this cosmic marvel of an experience if you go to this movie and can think only of the scientific inaccuracies you should be cast in the tv series big bang theory as sheldon long lost father ,7
en,1812626543,this film transports you to space in every cinematic way possible the visual effects are so brilliantly executed it makes you wonder if they shot part of it in space incredibly effective long takes throughout the film bring the realism and suspense that none other space film has ever done before the acting is subtle and engaging sandra bullock deserves another oscar after this as well as best director for alfonso cuaron and cinematography for emmanuel lubezki i cannot recommend this film enough ground breaking beautiful and technically perfect film schools will be studying this film in the future really enjoyed it although no fan of clooney,8
en,1812626543,when i saw avatar in #d i thought this #d adds nothing to the movie at all since then i have avoided the more expensive #d films but i wound up watching gravity in #d and i have to admit that i find it difficult to imagine how it would be without it directed by cuaron this is an artist really thinking through the technology rather than simply tossing out cool effects the opening space walk scene is amazing not because a bunch of things fly at the camera but because you just have this amazing sense of floating in #d space the movie is stunningly filmed and its suspenseful story of survival is consistently engrossing and well paced it is so well written and filmed that it is probably quite good even in #d but if any movie makes the case for #d as a tool for serious film making it is this one ,9
en,1812626543,gravity is a stunning portrayal of reality created through computer generated imagery blended with live action are there technical flaws in the crafting of this magnificent creation perhaps if there were i was unaware of them as i am not an expert on space travel and if there were they can easily be forgiven as there are no flaws in the presentation of the story as the events in this film unfold there is a sense of intense urgency that grabs hold of the viewer and does not let go until the final scenes the fragility of the film main character is its cause one can make a parallel between the character utter vulnerability and that of our planet which has an almost constant presence on the screen while the film heroine faces the challenge of being adrift in space with a finite supply of oxygen the earth has a fragile and finite atmosphere that is vital to human existence just as she struggles to ensure her continued supply of oxygen we struggle to maintain an atmosphere on earth capable of sustaining life in her quest the heroine encounters one setback after another while we face the challenge of ever growing levels of toxicity in our atmosphere with one setback after another to the effort of countering its growth the film auteur alfonso cuar n may have merely been creating an action thriller i would like to think his motive went much deeper no matter his motives gravity is a masterpiece on many levels and should not be missed ,9
en,1812626543,i have two major cinematic regrets from #### the first is that i believed that a good day to die hard could not possibly be as bad as the reviews were claiming i was wrong to trust that the series might regain it footing thanks bruce willis now i have trust issues my second regret is that i foolishly failed to catch gravity in theaters this movie is probably one of the most visually stunning films i have ever seen the plot is fairly simple but the massively impressive production value more than compensates director alfonso cuar n has crafted a thrilling survival film set in the harshest environment humans well a select few anyway have endured space it follows the tribulations of dr ryan stone stone is a mission specialist with nasa that has been sent into orbit to perform upgrades to the hubble telescope in her first assignment disaster strikes on her first spacewalk when the russians destroy one of their satellites and the debris cloud rockets around in orbit detonating other satellites and creating a lethal wave of shredded metal careening around the earth at ## ### mph the space shuttle is destroyed and most of the crew is killed leaving stone and mission commander matt kowalski as the sole survivors left drifting above the earth and counting the minutes until the debris next deadly pass stone will need to face her fears if she hopes to survive as she and kowalski must find a means of returning to earth alive i am a space geek and have been for as long as i can remember as much as i love science fiction and i do quite a bit there have been few films that have ever given much effort to portray space as it actually is there always some sort of convenient technology to prevent the filmmakers from having to deal with the harsh realities of space travel gravity is not science fiction but is instead a survival drama set in the environment of space and cuar n uses the full gamut of hazards that come with leaving the earth atmosphere there are no rocket boots to make maneuvering in space a simple task here well there a sort of jet pack unit used in limited capacity but the danger still remains that if stone or kowalski make one wrong move they will find themselves slowly drifting off for a lonely horrifying death as they wait for their air supply to run out gravity is not ### accurate to the trials and tribulations of surviving in space and some liberties were taken for the sake of telling a story but it so much more realistic than has been portrayed in pretty much any movie that come before cuar n and his team have found a way of realistically portraying total weightlessness so well that i could not wait to watch the behind the scenes footage to find out how it was done i loved that there were no sleek fancy spaceships and we get legitimate recreations of existing space structures such as the international space station and the visuals are just incredible this is a movie that for the utmost effect should be viewed in imax #d i missed out and watched the movie in high definition when it was released on home video but i saw enough and was wowed enough to know that i had missed out on something incredible the earth as seen from orbit is an amazing backdrop for a film and there was not a single moment of this film that i did not find absolutely gorgeous i realize i have spent most of this comment ranting about my love for the film visuals but that because it the best reason to see this film the story is very simple stone eventually left to her own devices must confront her fear of death and find a means of escaping her fate it primarily just stone sandra bullock traversing from one hope to another as she goes from station to station searching for a functional escape capsule while dodging the debris blender i hate to undermine it because it still an exciting story and it keeps you on the edge of your seat from the very beginning stone is a sympathetic character and we learn bits about her as the story progresses and watch as she eventually buckles under the pressure of her situation at this point we know that bullock is a talented actress and she does well in this movie where she pretty much the entirety of the cast for most of the film cuar n and bullock manipulate your emotions and keep you invested until the final frame and it all combines with the director amazing vision to create one of the coolest movies i have seen in a long time ,9
en,1812626543,i watched this movie in #d with very open mind as i have not seen its trailer before watching it this movie is best cinematic experience i have had after avatar seriously i do not prefer to watch movies in #d but this movie have some serious #d effect during the whole movie i was sitting on the edge on my seat definitely worth every penny watching it in cinema loved it the music the cinematography the effects all were just out of this world this movie easily tops in to one of my favourite top ## movies of all time ,10
en,1812626543,star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning ryan sandra bullock and matt george clooney are two astronauts working on a space station whilst trying to juggle their respective emotional baggage all is going smoothly only for a big disaster to strike and the pair finding themselves desperately trying to get to safety when ryan finds herself stranded on her own as the less experienced explorer she must use all her wits in a desperate struggle for survival alfonso cuaron short critically acclaimed space drama plunges us straight in to the action from the start slowing closing in on our two main characters who we are forced to make a connection with on the basis of some piecemeal small talk as they go about their business with the famous performers playing them relying on their assured seasoned on screen personas that they have each developed over many years with clooney smooth talking wise cracking man man approach coupled with bullock hard ass cynical girl in a man world thing shortly after we feel all settled in the realization slowly dawns on the characters and the audience that something wrong and the tension sets in and we feel as though we are in with these people as they are forced to rely on their instinctive human ingenuity to survive interjected between the various seat edge moments our heroes are left merely to wonder aimlessly but as they do they and we are witness to some truly breath taking cinematography of the vast spacial glacier and the outstanding grand space station leaving the wow factor on more than one level at some point bullock becomes stranded from her companion and forced to survive on her own as the tension and the stakes start to rise that little bit higher somehow in the space of under an hour and a half you are left feeling as though your senses have been taken on a visceral mind bending ride where by the end it become genuinely nerve wracking as to whether she will survive even though inside we are pretty sure alfonso cuaron has crafted an original novel picture that takes a well trodden format but delivers it in a way that you really have not seen before clooney and bullock are an effective double act even when they are not actually on screen together and it deserved to win the awards and get the acclaim it did ,10
en,-16449932,in a few words i found the movie to be very surprising and one can think hours about the real intention d lynch had with this story i hope i figured it out not sure though it was a great movie one of the best on video i have seen this last year ,9
en,-16449932, originally reviewed ## ## #### an unusual picture but one of considerable depth intelligence and first rate performances naomi watts is my favourite actress she is beautiful but also has an undeniable talent within her acting she never play the same character and most of the time picks projects that require an actress of efficiency and considerable ability for which she is perfect for here the acting is sublime especially watts laura harring and surprisingly justin theroux who are among a talented cast that also features robert forster and dan hedaya the story is so complex that i found myself wondering if what i thought had happened actually happened and there many plot points that can be left open for discussion as to what actually took place but in a positive way this is a film that requires thinking and tremendous thought one that is a mystery that may never be solved and i was blown away by its unique style and refreshing storyline there will never be a film quite like mulholland drive a film of originality and superb craft there plenty of great writing an erotic lesbian sex sequence between watts and harring a superb background score and excellent direction from david lynch there always a mystical mood strong atmosphere absorbing cinematography and very good original dialogue i will have to view mulholland drive again and again to try and uncover some of its mysteries and this is something i look forward to as i just loved this film craft performances and strangely excellent way of plotting i think this could be one of the best films of the ## decade and naomi watts has quite possibly gave the best performance by an actress i have ever seen mulholland drive is a masterpiece of cinema an indie film that deserves repeated viewings to fully understand it greatness ,10

en,-16449932,i will keep this brief lynch could have done better with this movie i left the theater hot bothered and confused but with lynch what else is new you could at least follow to some extent what was happening in his previous films the last ## ## minutes of md goes off into every other direction instead of where it should be going to tie together the first hour and a half of the movie i guess i will get it on dvd when it comes out because i have to see it again because i know there is some point to that movie if you are not a david lynch fan and you want to get to know his style mulholland drive is not the place to start try twin peaks or blue velvet ,5
en,-16449932,well i saw this movie three nights ago and it is still with me so that says a lot i think it is a beautiful fascinating and evocative film and good films about hollywood and the movie biz are few and far between i love good movies set in hollywood my personal all time favorite is into the night with michelle pfeiffer when she was very young and really beautiful and not so affected and jeff goldblum and clu gulager as for david lynch i loved twin peaks and am still ticked off that it was canceled all these years later i did not like blue velvet so much though so i guess that makes me objective after reading the lengthy plot summary here on imdb immediately after seeing the film i immediately got a handle on the movie intricate structure and therefore did not have to wrangle with it until i came to a similar conclusion actually my only complaint with lynch is the blue box and key and the really tiny little people totally ludicrous and unnecessary if there had been no blue box no blue key and no really tiny little people i think the movie would have been better much better and no damage would have been done whatsoever these particular elements added nothing but a touch of the ridiculous to what otherwise would have been a much better piece of work we the audience would have caught on that the blonde lady was nutsy coo coo without those ridiculous elements somebody needs to reign lynch in a bit for his own good ,7
en,-1687525771,this is the worst sci fi film that i have ever seen the effects remind me of doctor who i was so looking forward to and waiting to watch this that i got side tracked by the hype i have been reading watching and absorbing sci fi and fantasy for ## years and this without doubt is the most pathetic effort that i have ever seen i have just watched gene roddenberry adromeda we never got to see it here i have watched farscape that was made here oh so was above and beyond that we never got to see here but now we get to see v again i d like to see the wheel of time by robert jordan or mistborn by brandon sanderson or some science fiction that makes sense ,1
en,-1687525771,i almost never write reviews for movies but i am a native indian whose brother was in the iraq war which is why i would like to comment about this piece that is passing itself off as a great movie the white liberals who watched this movie apparently did not notice how racist it was james cameron may be a liberal but his white man condescension shines through more than ever i do not think the na vi represent a native indian tribe i actually think they represent an african tribe but it does not matter the na vi are some kind half animal half human hybrid and since they represent tribal cultures the message being sent is perfectly clear african or native indians if you prefer are subhuman liberals do not see their own hypocrisy they accuse conservatives of being racist and dogmatic but they do not see their own racism and their own dogmatism as a native indian i was fed all this nonsense about climate change and the urgent need to save mother earth until my friend showed me a video by lord christopher monckton science adviser to margaret thatcher which disproved it all if anyone interested i suggest you go to http www youtube com watch v #zoxmj#jd # for some enlightenment yes avatar lovers all the save the planet stuff in this movie is based on bad science now let me just declare here and now that as a native i am sick and tired of liberals blaming white people for what they did to my culture and other cultures around the world yes we we are victimized but that was in the past it not like the us and europe were the only violent people in the history of mankind personally i am sick of movies that constantly portray black people native people and women as victims of an imperialist culture liberals do not care about any of those people all they care about is pushing progressive ideas and they enjoy using causes like racism and the environment to do it their actual agenda is to push socialism on america and make the sexual revolution that they started in the sixties go on forever they cannot come out directly and say that so they hide behind dead causes even worse there own hypocritical racism is all too apparent as i mentioned before i currently live in the uk but i was born in the us i am proud to be from a capitalist country and i am proud to be an american the only reason european countries can sustain their socialist tree hugging animal loving promiscuous culture is because the united states spends a lot of its capitalist wealth on weapons to protect them if it was not for the us their progressive governments and cultures would not even be possible something the brilliant james cameron should have considered before making this pacifist piece of propaganda ,1
en,-1687525771,i did not have a single idea about this movie before it came out the trailer did not look so good and i thought it just another animation movie but when i found out it james cameron with ### million budget i thought i would give it a try so i went to its premiere it completely blew me away it been so long since the first time i saw stars war this feeling i thought will never have again and avatar restored my faith in movies for # hours i left this world and wandered on the beautiful breath taking pandora i was like living my childhood fantasy the cgi the plot actions emotions the characters the love story almost every aspect of a great movie is in avatar there was time when i was to jump off my seat and grab a dragon for myself i sat there when the credit rolled and did not want it to end i was in love with pandora and the na vi people go see it take your kids to see it tell your friends to see it a once in a life time ride you do not want to miss ,10

en,-1687525771,avatar is one of the rare once in a decade movies that transcends by having the whole much more than the sum of the parts everything you could want in a movie is there mood atmosphere acting character story and above all a wholly realized digital world seamlessly blended into a movie reality huge attention to detail was also evident in just about every aspect of the film in summary pandora is lovingly portrayed as a world perhaps much more compelling and livable than ours there were a few liberties with the plot most evidently regarding the rare mineral that humans were mining which was a little contrived but that was easily forgivable perhaps a more realistic approach would be that humans wanted the entire planet for colonization but that may not have been as satisfying as what was shown ,10
en,-1687525771,when akira kurosawa made seven samurai in the ##s he never thought that people will consider his movie a masterpiece and him one of the greatest directors of the twentieth century his passion for excellence was his driving force and being a perfectionist he made it with all his heart no matter how much time it took there are very few directors who master the art of movie making not because they know it but because they want to make something different every time and excel in their field james cameron is one of them when he made terminator it was ahead of time same was the case with abyss or aliens and titanic and now its avatar some viewers did not like the movie mainly because they went with too much expectations about the story and performance this movie is not about the story its not about the actors its neither about performances but its about taking your viewers to different world its about making them see something they have never seen before when you watch it again you will realize that such movies can never be made again the cgi created on screen is so advanced and complete that you enter a different world altogether and leave the theater spellbound and watch it on #d as such movies are made for #d mark my words ## years from now people will realize that avatar was a masterpiece and james cameron the greatest movie maker of ##st century ,10
en,-1687525771,i loved the film and i was throughly entertained i do have a problem though i am becoming increasingly annoyed with the people that say this movies plot is simple and easy to follow so that makes it a bad movie of course the plot is simple and easy to follow it a f film made for entertainment purposes aimed at targeting all the demographics that it can the movie cost ### million to make how the f is a man expected to make his money back and be successful with a film that only jack film students can understand because they expect the plot of the movie to be some radical idea people are trying to say that the plot loses merit because of the fact that the idea was basically taken from the story of the native americans what are you people f dull thats like trying to say that a plot with the morals of good vs evil were stolen from the lion king it irritates me to see all you people criticizing james cameron for the story of this movie when you know damn well that it took him almost like ## years to write the screen play and that the screen play itself is actually very in depth with wonderful character development and at least respectable dialouge i myself am a film student too and i know what its like to be a jack that assumes he right about everything when it comes to criticizing a movie but i also know when i have been entetained by a film i have not been this entertained by a film in over a year james cameron has once again used his visionary directing skills and his power with storytelling to completely engage the viewer in this masterpiece of a science fiction film watching this film was one of the most enjoyable experiences i have had with a science fiction fantasy film since lord of the rings or star wars and everybody knows they enjoy those films so do not try and act cool or smart by saying you do not cause you will look like an idiot oh and i am sorry i must have forgotten but when was the last time any of you wrote and directed the most expensive movie of all time and grossed over a billion dollars worldwide at box offices in your first # weeks ,9
en,1268335734,gran torino takes place in the tough streets of modern day detroit michigan it chronicles the unlikely bond between two neighbors a fatherless troubled hmong teen named thao bee vang and a racist old korean war vet named walt kowalski clint eastwood eastwood #### the underlying theme of the film is personal struggle and overcoming cultural barriers in order to form lasting friendships the film starts out with walt basically hating thao and all individuals of asian descent due largely to his korean war days and partly because he is a crabby old man thao then commits a crime against walt and tries to make things right in doing so they begin to get close and walt sees more than just a hmong thief but a young man with promise and need of direction walt provides that direction and gives the fatherless thao a male role model that he has not had in one scene we see walt trying to show thao how to talk to other men in a barber shop scene the result is a comical misunderstanding by thao that furthers the bond walt also teaches the young man about women work and his beloved gran torino a classic car that walt helped build as an auto worker he teaches thao about taking pride in his surroundings walt teaches thao a lot but what is really striking is what the boy teaches the old man thao teaches walt about forgiveness acceptance and in the end they both teach us something about redemption the tension in the film is provided by the neighborhood hmong gang that is trying to recruit thao walt provides protection to thao family that ends up causing them great harm thao wants to spill the blood of the gang members and walt also sees no other answer as well but he does not want his young friend to get hurt or end up in prison what will walt do to save his friend and their family film enthusiasts will appreciate the use of lighting and music in this film one scene using lighting to affect our mood is when walt is contemplating what to do about the gang the local priest comes to talk to walt and finds him sitting alone in a pitch dark room walt talks in simple growls and we get the sinking feeling of walt anger the scene where music is used to raise our level of angst is when walt initially confronts the gang a fight is taking place at the neighbor house and spills into walt lawn big mistake the music raises our tension level and we see walt holding a gun to the face of a gang member growling at him to get off his lawn american history x is a movie that addresses racism to a more severe extent than gran torino like gran torino american history x shows what can happen when racism is set aside and our eyes are opened to new relationships kaye #### a gripping movie full of suspense and a handful of laughs gran torino is a great movie about overcoming boundaries and what can happen when we let our guard down a little even for a crabby old man ,9
en,1268335734,even at this advanced age clint eastwood is still one of the top actors in movies he can hang just fine with the current fleet of leading men just fine on top of that he one of the premier directors in hollywood churning out some of the most interesting and intelligent movies made the story about a retired auto factory worker who stuck in his ways he basically playing a much older version of dirty harry callahan but living in detroit you get the idea not many other actors i can think of could have pulled off this role so effectively to be an actor of advanced age like clint but still have the grit and tenacity that he always had clint is not going to let down to a bunch of neighborhood punk kids ,10
en,-870195436,shutter island is an excellent suspenseful thriller with some flaws which i will get into later but the good more than outweighs that bad in this one director martin scorsese is admirable in making shutter island giving audiences nearly everything they could expect or want from one of these films leonard dicaprio is great as always as teddy daniels a us marshal on route to a remote island for the criminally insane to investigate the disappearance of a murderess who somehow escaped from her locked hospital room or as ben kingsley mysterious head dr crawley explains we do not know how she got out of her room it as if she evaporated straight through the walls leonardo dicaprio brings an intensity to the role like in blood diamond and the deaprted to name a couple and at times vulnerability he continues to show audiences and critics his talent as an actor this film is no different well done the rest of the talented cast including mark ruffalo ben kingsley michelle williams emily mortimer and max von sydow in a small role are effective as the supporting characters in their limited screen time particia clarkson elias kosteas john carroll lynch ted levine and jackie earl haely are also very good in their brief extended appearances since most of the story focus is on dicaprio which is not necessarily a bad thing shutter island turned out to be much better than expected it has an interesting story suspense an eerie mood and atmosphere with strong performances from the cast the movie also has some nice twists and surprises one i sort of did suspect and others i found surprising to say the least so it better to avoid spoilers and watch this film without knowing too much about the plot for you to truly enjoy shutter island i found this film to be much better than others who disguise themselves as suspense thrillers the grudge the happening and shutter to name a few i enjoyed that scorsese did not heavily rely on cg except for some and instead used for the most part realistic locations and atmosphere to create the suspense the location they chose for the island was a perfect setting for this story to take place and it added a lot to the movie the flashback sequences of teddy time in world war # were an interesting touch that give us some insight into his traumatic past which continues to plague him while on the island the pace of the movie was a little slow in the beginning before the suspense really started to kick into high gear but overall i cannot think of all that much i did not like about this film sure it might have some tiny flaws including a surprise i sort of saw coming but i thought scorsese still did a good job with the execution of the twist none the less in some ways shutter island reminded me a bit of the shining because both films used actual locations surreal images and atmosphere to create suspense build up instead of relying on cgi i was impressed with this movie and i plan to watch it again sometime because second viewings i think are needed to fully understand the story so it makes sense not that the story itself is very complicated but i believe shutter island worth watching a second time even with a ### minute running time because the film is that good despite it few flaws if you are in the mood for a suspenseful thriller or you are a fan of the genre you cannot go wrong with shutter island it has an intricate story suspense twists surprises and solid performances by the cast especially dicaprio ruffalo and kingsley who make this thriller worth the time to watch ,8
en,-870195436,many people questioned acclaimed director martin scorsese choosing to helm a pure genre film in the psychological thriller shutter island but the marriage of one of the masters of crime drama and a dennis lehane mystic river gone baby gone novel is as close to an ideal match as it sounds although scorsese is capable of applying his skills to more meaningful work than a mystery he able to play around a lot more with technique style light and color to turn a somewhat predictable mystery into a captivating thriller many great thrillers have taken place within the walls of an insane asylum and shutter island takes this to the max the isolated east coast island is home to the most dangerous of the criminally insane when two u s marshals dicaprio and ruffalo come to the island to investigate the mysterious disappearance of one of the inmates they find themselves up to their necks in an even bigger mystery involving the hospital and everyone in it as daniels investigates we learn he is somewhat intimately tied to the case and the facility he lost his wife in a fire and the man who set it is locked up somewhere on the island daniels has dreams of his wife coming to him and speaking to him turning to ash in his arms he even starts to hallucinate while awake scorsese certainly has not had a lot of opportunity to play with false reality in his films so he relishes these opportunities dream sequences are often pointless but scorsese makes them intriguing beautiful and haunting all at once despite their excessive use he picks powerful images that might make you shake your head at times but they enhance the mystery in the long run numerous scenes give scorsese a chance to show off when he investigates the mysterious ward c daniels has nothing but matches as he speaks to one of the prisoners someone he knew off the island he continues to light matches to see a new one every time one burns out scorsese develops a rhythm of creepy dialogue from jackie earl haley and quick shots of the match striking flint then lighting the actors faces dull moments are extremely rare in shutter island scorsese gets the most out of each scene but the film does not conceal its hand all that well a few lines of dialogue connect some if not most of the dots so the impact of the last several minutes aka the big reveal is not as effective as some of the great thrillers out there without scorsese and the talents of dicaprio however shutter island might have ended up just a decent film as opposed to a very good one it too impressively executed to be bunched in with the bulk of decent thrillers out there but not clever and original enough to be among the genre elite scorsese might be capable of better but shutter island proves his versatility more so than take anything away from his legacy steven c visit my site at http moviemusereviews com,8
en,-870195436,shutter island which would be worse to live as a monster or to die as a good man this movie has to be appreciated for its unusual way of unfolding so well is the mix of story screenplay and direction that halfway into the movie and you feel like on shutter island scorsese brilliance is what makes the movie fantastic and add to it a stellar performance by leonardo dicaprio shutter island is a complicated story i wo not write much about that based on one person imagination to let himself off being the person he really is as in the words of the dr cawley ben kingsley he constructed the most radical cutting edge role play ever attempted in psychiatry to successfully bring back the patient to his normal terms of life in the end what happens is the most interesting part and i was floored after seeing the same i love these kind of movies where in the viewer needs to put actual effort to understand the story plot characters and even be able to relate to them for better understanding shutter island is successful upto certain level in all of these fronts the credits say that shutter island is actually made from a novel i have not read it the screenplay and editing is good cinematography should be appreciated as well as the production design and the art direction in a nutshell a highlights great effort for the detailing very good performances by the cast namely leonardo mark ruffalo chuck ben kingsley dr cawley and others background score adds to the feel of being in a state of confusion b usp the intrigue story and the director fine job my rating # ##,7
en,1425373818,this is one of those flicks that no one knows how to comment on until after it wins lots of awards and then finally everyone can say what a great movie it is well let me say first that i love clint eastwood and morgan freeman and i really thought that this would be a movie about a woman overcoming odds to become a boxer instead boxing seemed to take a back seat to everyone angst frankie eastwood family crisis with his daughter maggie swank crisis with her family it just goes on and on i wanted to love this movie but found myself spiraling into some deep depression by the end does that make it a great movie because it made me depressed i do not think so does it make eastwood brilliant because i felt like i was crawling on the ground by the final scene not really it made me wonder about clint eastwood and how happy he is as a person and what kind of relationship he has with his family members it made me wonder why morgan freeman has not become a bigger star than he is and why he always has to talk over the movie it made me wonder why hilary swank took such a role that was so odd and yet so predictable from the start my movie companion said he knew after the first ten minutes that things were not going to go well for maggie we both ended up so depressed that we had to switch the channel to a news station to revive our spirits sorry everyone i really did not like this movie and scratched my head over all the rave reviews ,1
en,1425373818,saw this last night in la without much knowing what to expect had not read many reviews only knew i liked the work of the three main stars swank carries the film and is at her absolute best the last ## minutes are some of the most powerful film making i can remember eastwood is also in top form but allows swank performance to trump his own freeman is outstanding and might have done enough to earn a best supporting actor nomination this is so much more than a boxing movie but it right there with raging bull and rocky i saw the aviator two days ago and enjoyed mdb more however the film is not without fault eastwood has a tendency to allow scenes to go on too long and to fill them with too much dead air the dialogue at times appears a little too ad libbed there are some minor logical inconsistencies but the positives far outweigh the negatives ,10
en,1425373818,the major honor of the movie was obviously a very nice collection of actors and actresses specially morgan which always acts as he been living with the character i do not exactly know why swank was given the oscar for this movie it kind of strange i myself have not seen anything in this across of course she is fine but not that good to be honored as the best leading actress and about clint he was not himself on this movie and the only remarkable part of the movie was when he was standing beside the ring and hillary got the final shot he changed his face very nice and i loved it morgan is always perfect the more you notice at him the more you understand how fine he acts the story was kind of joke it was just meant to be a drama just to impress sentimental people and make them rave about the,5
en,1425373818,everything what i had to say about this piece of propaganda is already in my summary i must add i have never expected clint eastwood to direct and act in in a flick like this i was in state of shock when the movie ended and not for its plot i assure you i just could not believe it was made by this clint eastwood not some other clint eastwood o perhaps its highest time to retire mr eastwood do not you think so let us remember you as fine talented actor that you still are rather than a director of thick propaganda laced politically correct flicks and what was so outstanding about hillary swank acting to deserve an oscar i could have understand this choice had she been from a jewish family but since she is not excuse me but her acting was not any better than the acting of spiderman girlfriend whatever her name was hell even anette bening was better than swank in being julia and she always stink catalina sandino moreno was real actress in a leading role for #### oscars unfortunately her film and character were not oh so politically correct piece of insert your favorite bad word here oh well we all know for quite some time that academy awards are what they are free publicity stunts for the insiders televised to less and less every year other countries # ## including # points for clint eastwood role and acting ,6
en,-870616449,ok now although i thought this movie was good the two things that kept annoying me every time i had to stare at them were captain america come on the rubber baby helmet look was terrible are you telling me that they could not find a better look for him the costume was terrible # i know it traditional but come on come up with something new the light blue was terrible and looked like a child costume i mean the darker blue in captain america the #st avenger was better than in avengers # the rubber baby helmet what the hell it looked terrible they could have done something that came up to his ears and wrapped around his head letting his hair come out the top sorta of like cyclops in xmen i am sorry the full head cover was absolutely terrible chris evans is a good looking actor show him off more not make him look ridiculous i mean if they can revamp superman costume and make it look fantastic they need to go back on the drawing board on captain americas costume the hulk honestly i could not stand looking at him the digital creation they had was horrible they went from the hulk #### which was a bit cartoonish but ok to the incredible hulk #### which i think was fantastic the cgi was fantastic you could see muscle def hair moved instead of looked glued down and looked like a hulk the hulk they had in the avengers look run down old smaller i always envisioned hulk as a big massive thing this hulk was barely towering over anyone i am sorry i just did not agree with the thing they had there at all but because they have recast the hulk like ## times also brings down the appeal how can you really build up your appeal for the character if you keep changing out the actor that is an epic fail but other than that i liked the movie was very good better than the xmen why because they were actually fighting something bigger than the screen i hate like xmen where everyone they were fighting was the same and so small they needed to throw in an apocalypse onslaught something was the enemy is a real enemy so other than those small changes i think the movie was great for its genre,8
en,-870616449,it has been a long time since i have anticipated a summer movie season as much as i have anticipated #### and what better way to kick it off than with one of the most anticipated movies of well if not the decade then at least the last # years the avengers was a very impressive accomplishment by joss whedon and it was well worth the wait this is one of those movies that had its work cut out for it for quite some time this was going to take some skill as a movie maker how in the world would anyone be able to bring all of these larger than life characters together in such a way that it would not seem too jammed packed and jumbled up for its own good how would all of these heroes be showcased in a movie that is almost all main character and lead actor and to answer those questions all i can really say is this i do not know and after seeing the movie i still do not know all i know is that it was done and it was done very well i have to admit when i found out whedon was going to be at the helm for this one i had some doubts which i will admit were only based on my lack of attention to most of his work as a writer however after seeing cabin in the woods a few weeks ago i saw what whedon was able to accomplish with what was technically a film that goes into the horror genre but really was one of the best and unique films i have seen in a long time and even though he was only a script writer for cabin anyone who knows anything at all about screenplays knows that that was one that was penned by a very talented and creative guy so at that point i was more than convinced that he could pull off something great with the avengers and after seeing it tonight it safe to say that whedon was certainly quite up for this task if you love movies then go see this one it has the action it has the acting and more than anything and is so important when it comes to a film like this it has the story and script this is the quintessential summer movie that everyone hopes for but and this is the good part it also got so much more that makes it so much more than the quintessential summer movie so the summer movie season has officially arrived and now the rest of the season has its work cut out for it ,9
en,-870616449,while there already literally hundreds on reviews of marvel the avengers available on the web here a spoiler free review for the thousands of us viewers yet to see the movie for me may is avengers month i bought my first marvel comic avengers ## in may #### and it was may #### that i was lucky enough to get my photo in avengers # so although the movie opened here in new zealand on april ## i waited until may # before seeing the movie with most of my family i tried to get in with my avengers id the cashier thought it was cool but i still had to pay and i do not begrudge a single cent of the ## ## entry fee the premise of the avengers as a team of fictional heroes is that the team is greater than the sum of its parts and this movie is a rare example where the same is true of the cast and crew with this movie everyone the director writers actors special effects designers have all hit their mark with hawkeye precision producing a new bench mark in action and comic book based entertainment kevin fiege joss whedon and the rest of the crew have expertly delivered an avengers tale for today that still respectfully pays homage to the #### comic book origins of earth mightiest heroes while mixing with the best elements of the ultimate universe version of the heroes for those who think they know the story from all trailers and t v spots think again there are still surprises aplenty from the very first scene through to the end and there is not a single wasted line of dialog in the whole ### minutes contrary to the speculation that there would be no room for character development with so many big name stars and characters in the room at the same time there are many introspective conversations that progress the story and the characters reprising his tony stark iron man character robert downey jr is clearly steals the show and his interactions with pepper cap thor loki and bruce banner include many laugh out loud moments tim hiddleston loki is even more likable as a villain than he was in thor samuel l jackson gets the opportunity for more on screen time and we learn more about his motivations and methods it was very pleasing to see chris hemsworth thor chris evans cap clarke gregg agent coulson and stellan skarsgard erik selvig all behave in character with their earlier appearances in the cannon of movies that culminates in the avengers and it was like picking up the next issue of an epic limited series as an aside marvel has released a limited series avengers prelude fury big week that helps tie the movies together and provides some background information mark ruffulo portrayal of bruce banner differs from eric bana and edward norton but it is in a way that adds to the dynamics newcomer agent maria hill played by cobie smulders has a bigger role than expected and again adds to the contemporary relationship with the avengers in the printed medium the battle scenes are well choreographed with a sense of panel by panel progress and the thor iron man captain america conflict pays obvious homage to the big three and elicit memories of stand off and avengers prime in fact every character has their chance to shine in solo action pitted against each other and eventually against the common foe that no single super hero could withstand scarlett johansson black widow character comes out from the shadow of the big guns and she and jeremy renner hawkeye earn their place on the team there plenty of visual humor too especially from the hulk and the collective gasp from the audience at the unexpected death scene is evidence of the emotional bond between characters and viewers i am sure there some die hard fans that are lamenting the lack of hank pym but i cannot honestly think of anything that would have made this movie better than what it was in short this is the movie equivalent of the kree skrull war that no marvel or avengers fan should miss truly outstanding cannot wait for the blu ray for christmas and then there the mid credit trailer roll on avengers # ,10

en,-870616449,i knew this movie was going to be good but i thought ## on rottentomatoes and # # on imdb was a little too much for a movie like this oh boy how wrong i was this film was not good it was epic with all caps and an exclamation mark we have all our favorite heroes in a single movie played by some great actors driven by over the top special effects and co ordinated by a skillful director who also rocks with the dialogs i think it took a great deal of pre production and in production work by joss wheedon to make these unique characters work well in a single film and he did a terrific job in keeping together all these amazing actors there was no dull moment in this film it was very well paced wonderfully done and greatly enjoyed the first half consisted of getting all the heroes together introducing the plot and the characters but it was done with such finesse that i did not even realize how long this part took the film was very entertaining throughout with hilarious comic reliefs exciting action and wonderful score by alan silvestri i loved when all of the avengers were together and just talked because the awesome script really showed their character and why they are not really good as a team but they finally got on with each other and the final battle commenced the most epic final battle after of course lord of the rings there a shot in this scene which just blew my mind it was a single shot with no cuts at all showing all the characters fighting the alien hordes and it was just fantastic i first felt sad when i heard edward norton wo not be reprising his role as bruce banner but as soon as mark ruffalo appeared on screen i thought way better than ed norton they made a great choice in casting him he was much more convincing and less greedy norton may be angry with himself but he wo not turn green anymore what joss wheedon did really well is that he deepened all the supporting characters we have seen in the other films we learned a lot about black widow about hawkeye and even about agent coulson the writer is really great with all the different characters because it feels like we are watching people who could very well exist not just superhero cardboard cut outs most films like this ahem superman ahem only have that i can honestly say i loved the avengers i do not care if it too mainstream the superhero movies are my favorite sub genre i recommend it to all watch it love it enjoy it i cannot wait for more ,10

en,-284064120,spoilers follow two questions might trouble the curious # why is phil trapped in groundhog day in the first place and # why or how does he eventually escape we are never told and rightly so the answer to the first question cannot possibly matter unless perhaps it part of an answer to the second but while watching the film for the first time the second question in the form of what can phil do in order to escape preoccupied me and i thought he was on the right track several times when he kidnapped and killed the groundhog when he persuaded rita to stay with him for the crucial hour when he tried to save the life of the old tramp who might for all i knew have been father time i think there is an answer to both questions and it is this phil is trapped on the #nd of february for no reason whatever and consequently there is no reason whatever for his escape but let me consider the competing theories first # phil is reliving the same day again and again until he gets it right if this is so he may very well have to repeat february # a few times too # phil is trapped in order to become a better person and so he is released when he has made up for lost time and done with groundhog day precisely as much as he ought to have done with the previous portion of his life # phil is reliving the same day until he exhausts all the possibilities either of the day itself or of the position he is in this third hypothesis is a good description of what the film itself is doing which is why it such a great film the film does what it can to exhaust the possibilities before it ends and we feel that it has done so of course it has not it cannot have but perhaps phil in the many moments when we were not looking has # the same cruel demon which imprisoned phil in a town he loathes on a day he loathes sets him free just when he has made a permanent peace with the situation i like all of these theories and i will not insist upon mine if mine is right though two things follow which feel right to me there was no need for phil to have escaped at all and the fact that he ends up with the not particularly interesting or lovable rita in his arms was pure accident even if he lives the rest of his life as though it was not why is this a great movie not because in the end it fails to tell us which of the five main competing possibilities is right but because it so artlessly and humourously suggests all five at once ,10
en,-1752010102,the film the midnight cowboy stars dustin hoffman who plays ratso a crippled homeless man trying to survive on the streets of ny city and jon voight a young stud joe buck who moves from texas to ny with hopes of becoming a successful prostitute the two men cross paths and begin forming a strange relationship the pair end up desperate to survive on the dreary and dark streets of ny this film is a love story and the story is focused on the complex relationship between ratso and joe buck the relationship starts off rocky when ratso betrays joe bucks trust but somehow they meet again and end up living together their main goal is to become wealthy and move to florida they make several attempts at getting joe buck some jobs but none of them are ever really successful and they struggle quite hard in the city this film reminded me a lot of another film where dustin hoffman plays a man with autism rainman not just because it has dustin hoffman in the film but because it is much like another love story between two men they struggle in their differences but in the end they do fall in love with each other they start out on the rocks these relationships in the end of the films you can see their love over powers the disability of the crippled man the films are quite similar in those aspects midnight cowboy director john schelsinger does a great job of using different effects in the film to make it look very dingy dark mysterious and even in some scenes pretty trippy he uses several flash backs uses some black and white in the film and very good lighting techniques there are several scenes in an abandoned building they lived in that used just candle light for lighting as they of course did not have electricity the director did a great job of making this film look so real you felt as if this was really happening and like you were there with them there is a scene where the characters go to a party that uses several special effects to make you feel like you are in the characters head while they are on drugs throughout my viewing of the film i was not quite sure what the theme of this film was i thought maybe it was a coming of age story focusing on the character joe buck and then i thought maybe it was a film focusing on the struggle for human dignity yet again focusing on the character joe buck but as the relationship between ratso and joe buck grew and as i saw joe buck become obsessed with getting ratso to florida in order to heal him from his sickness i realized this was a love story and a tragic one at that ,8

en,871649949,pride and prejudice is a well know story that follows the # sisters of the bennet foray into relationships and marriage the backdrop of the story is set in england of the late ##th century an age where marriage pervaded more socially and financially than ones own choosing this is even more evident in the bennet since their house will fall out of their hands if mr bennet donald sutherland dies hence why making a good marriage is of utmost importance so we get to met quite a few eligible bachelors ranging from the tad shy mr bingley to the proud and stout mr darcy and the very inept mr collins the scenery and locations lends itself to your eyes and really enhances the love story by being truly visual amazing and talking about a pleasure for the eye keira knightley really shines in this movie she has received golden globes nomination for best actress for this role and it well deserved her performance is scintillating and she really fits the part as elizabeth donald sutherland is awesome and does his best part in a long time matthew macfadyen mr darcy provides both regal ship and vulnerability to his character and really portrays him well his chemistry with keira is also quite good unlike keira and adrien brody in the jacket the rest of the cast is also magnificent my only wish is that it should have been a bit longer so the elaborations of the relationships could really unfold jane austen fans would surely miss some scenes so i hope there will be a longer directors cut when it arrives on dvd all in all a very enjoyable adaption and one that should not be missed ,8
en,871649949,okay yes i just want to let you know i am a sucker for anything romance but this beats them all pride and prejudice is the best movie i have ever seen in my entire life i used to be obsessed with the movie the notebook but after seeing this that all changed there is not too much kissing stuff like in the notebook that you just get sick of after a while but it still keeps you hoping that lizzy and darcy will end up together i am not reading the book and i cannot wait to get it when it comes out on dvd this movie stays true to the book which is even better because i find when you read a book and then watch the movie like for example the notebook or harry potter they are a lot different than the movie which disappoints me but pride and prejudice even took lines out of the book which makes it very similar i have seen it in the theaters a couple times so i strongly suggest you see it ,10
en,871649949,the story is so well known it seems superfluous to go over it again if you have not read and loved the book one of the greats of english literature shame on you but knowing the story so well leaves the viewer at full liberty to pick as many holes in the film as we like so here goes keira knightley i find captivating and infuriating by turns at times her dark beauty eclipses everything else on screen small wonder she a huge star but her jollyhockeysticks accent and gummy toothy is not it fun smile drive me completely insane however overall she makes a pretty good lizzie and does the material and herself justice carrying the film well enough matthew mcfadyen darcy is more problematic i have revised my former opinion that he just a wet darcy this is not fair but his delivery is all wrong and really it must be part direction not just his fault he not really engaging with the material or with lizzie his clipped and rushed lines were almost comical racing to churn them out and when he asks lizzie in his plumiest tone did you have a good trip i burst out laughing it ridiculous trevor howard and celia johnson brief encounter all over again also as a good looking man the cinematographer and director ought to have been able to find the latent beauty in him and maximise it but i think this happens only rarely for example during his rainy first proposal when his face has the luminosity to show that he really cares about lizzie proud and foolish as he is i wonder not for the first time whether he not been hoist as it were by his own petrifying period hairstyle and clothes granted his character is itself at first stiff and formal but once he gets to know lizzie better he should change subtly and he does not you do not get to see how she affected him and in his snarling ripostes to lizzie playful thrusts he seems to be in a perpetual and sometimes rather bad tempered sulk casting and script alike reflect the charming infuriating conflict wickham chirping is bland ineffective and not charming dame judy seems to be the only actress of her age known to hollywood there are others you know i found bingley excellent in series # of rome incomprehensible sniggering and implausibly awkward like a sort of shakespearean buffoon but i loved brenda blethyn silly but nonetheless astute mrs bennett and claudie blakley made a very appealing down to earth charlotte lucas donald sutherland mr bennett is interestingly cast an ##th century man out of touch with the new century this reinterpretation of period is one of the film chief innovations and delights the bennett family and surroundings represent the rougher less polished ##th century while the expensive bingleys and darcys are the modern and determinedly fashionable face of the more restrictive and cold early ##th century i know which i would rather have lived in if i did not know intimately what would happen next in every single scene i think i would have got lost as script rehashes paid every sacrifice to the constraints of the modern film format periodically however screenwriter moggach dredges up beautiful snatches of long forgotten original dialogue which truly add to the charm of the piece i really disliked the second proposal both of them looking like they have walked out of a commercial for a chocolate bar or a shampoo i also did not much like the brazen and showy use of chatsworth as darcy home using so well known a building has an alienating effect engendering disbelief at a point in the story when you most need to believe in darcy as a real and not a fairytale man my favourite moment comes in a scene at bingley netherfield house lizzie and miss bingley have been taking a turn about the room and meantime exchanging sharp witticisms and sly flirting with darcy who sits writing in the centre of the room in the scene final shot darcy in the foreground pauses discomfited pen in hand while behind him the two ladies part and circle for all the world like cats circling prey a finely judged shot and in fact the whole film is beautifully shot and lit throughout however i find myself preferring the ##s fay weldon adaptation more and more as time goes by elizabeth garvie delicately drawn gentle lizzie and the stately pace and modest tone of the whole seem to suit my taste much better this sort of attempt to sex up what is already plenty sexy if you only ensure that the leads have chemistry and the sparkling witty dialogue remains firmly in place just makes the least of the available material of course as a woman in love with romanticism that does not mean i wo not be watching the dvd until it wears out,6
en,802756256,this is not your family superhero movie do not be taking your mom and dad or kids to go see this it perhaps the uninhibited superhero film we have been waiting for if you are into that sorta thing it not even really a superhero movie so much as it a comedy in a leotard ryan reynolds plays the title character wade wilson aka deadpool a mercenary who undergoes a special procedure to help cure him of his terminal cancer this ends up giving him special powers of self healing but also makes him look like a freak hence the mask meanwhile he afraid to see the love of his life vanessa morena baccarin because of what she might think of his new face the film plays around with the timeline a bit jumping back and forth between post superpower wade and everyday guy wade most likely to avoid any boredom or anxiety built up by superhero origins at it best it very very funny reynolds timing is excellent as the snarky insouciant rascal from the beginning the jokes are rapid fire it looks as though we are in for a guardians of the galaxy or ant man type of film but this goes way beyond that it breaks the fourth wall about a dozen times and occasionally has the star self deprecating himself at one point reynolds makes a quip about the film not having a big enough budget to feature any other x men characters the comedy can eventually get tiring for some not so much tiring actually just numbing but luckily the jokes come fewer and far between at about that point in the movie then we get the big action sequences and all that deadpool is definitely something new in this world of belabored superhero films and that probably the most refreshing part about the movie it never takes itself too seriously it does not give us some ridiculous villain who unstoppably giving a shot at world domination instead deadpool spends much of the film just trying to hunt down the man who turned him into a freak killing anyone standing in his way which is made to be funny until we realize there no real reason for any of these people to die in fact maybe deadpool is the villain after all but if looked at as a superhero action film it will evoke distaste in many however if you see it as a comedy then it all makes more sense and you can sit back and enjoy it it toys with this whole beauty is only skin deep theme but never really capitalizes on its impact instead the film cares more about its irreverence if this movie were to be amazing it would have found a perfect balance between heart and gall but honestly i do not even think it tried to twizard rating ##,8

en,802756256,it will probably be the most unpopular opinion from me but it the most honest my introduction to deadpool happened in the early ## when i was looking through the x men action figures at a wal mart and saw the character for the first time it looked cool but i dismissed him as another generic character that looked less like an x men and more a gi joe villain that would probably lose to snake eyes that was then and now he has his own film and i still do not understand the appeal i like the style and the gore factor i even chuckled at some of the jokes of the film when it comes down to the movie itself i just could not get into the character of wade wilson i thought he was annoying and loud throughout the whole thing i did not see anything unique about the fourth wall break as it been done to death and better in films such as fight club and ferris buellers day off the insane world created for the film is more appropriate for a japanese anime on a sugary high the villains are just there for deadpool to have an excuse to kill and the people he interacted with have more to say than our titular hero i felt like i was watching a superhero film directed by a guy that wanted to impress quentin tarantino after watching kill bill for the first time but did not realize he was better off watching shogun assassin instead i do not necessarily think it a bad movie i think it a funny romp on the superhero genre but should have focused more on the satire than making penis jokes and references no one understands deadpool is unique but is not as smart as it wants the audience to think it is this is ryan reynolds saving grace after so many failures and stinkers at the box office one comes to think will this film series be the only thing that will keep him from making straight to video or put him in obscurity i will admit i enjoyed the elements of it but that just it there are only elements to enjoy as the rest of the movie is a loud mtv film with too many bells and whistles and not enough meat if you want a good laugh stick to the naked gun series if you want carnage and blood stick to the best of ## action i give it a # out of ## it works when it has to despite it annoying character ,4
en,-1377124187,horror movies put their audience through a lot they jump and scream and their heart races throughout but unfortunately what most horror films lack is characters they do not usually have a big enough heart and their characters are all expendable whether or not this film fits into the category of horror is debatable but this story is horrific and dramatic it tells us about characters we care about and puts them through hell it as much a drama as a horror film and the mixture of both is impeccable seth brundle jeff goldblum is trying to woo magazine reporter veronica ronnie quaife geena davis brundle has an experiment that he been working on so he shows it to her it a teleportation device but it has a few problems like it inability to transport living things and keep them alive after finally getting it to work brundle accidentally and unknowingly mixes his d n a with a fly and soon starts transforming into a monster the characters are what this picture is all about jeff goldblum and geena davis have great chemistry together and they play off each other well this film starts off with goldblum and davis meeting each other and the first half of the film is dedicated to showing us these characters this is quite effective so the we care about what happens during the last half of the movie the other main character is stathis borans john getz and he the most miraculous character of them all he set up as a chauvinist villain but this movie does not give into stereotype that easy this character who has some horrible and rude qualities has a heart and shows that just because a character has bad qualities does not mean they have to be the villain the direction and writing is good the scenes looked well thought out and they could be pretty disturbing the makeup effects which won the #### academy award are very cool the transformation scenes rival those in #### an american werewolf in london for best disgusting makeup effects of ####s cinema howard shore musical score for this film is amazing it grand and bigger than it should be like the music from the ##s but it sounds great it a perfect mix of a loud brass section and a soft theme on the flute this story about a man transformation into a fly is sad and horrific with those words being used in the best sense this is a must see for horror fans my rating # # out of ## mins r for sexuality nudity strong violence and some language ,9
en,-1377124187,david cronenberg is a master of technological horror and always manages to create films chock full of interesting ideas the problem or really cool thing about some of his films however is that he lets his ideas overwhelm the story his films become more like puzzles than straight forward pictures and often require the viewer to sit back and decipher what they just saw while the fly still explores cronenberg characteristic theme of the transformation of the human body it does so in a way that never overwhelms the story the film remains at its core a tragic love story aided greatly by jeff goldblum very human performance the emotion here does not seem forced or artificial like some of his other movies scanners dead ringers but actually comes across as sincere for a director so consistently concerned with artificial human manipulation cronenberg has managed to create a film that is surprisingly genuine supplying this film with a good dose of what many of his others lack humanity ,10
en,912747377,around half a year before watching this movie i had watched leonardo dicaprio other film shutter island which i absolutely loved hearing that inception was similar i decided to view it after having now seen it i found it completely different and massively confusing but i understood enough of it to realise its brilliance the idea of undercover operatives stealing or planting ideas in peoples dreams seems simple enough but nolan has found a way to make it incredibly complex dicaprio and a number of accomplices journey into a dream within a dream within a dream offering the opportunity to have several heart racing action sequences all at once as well as some deeply emotional scenes involving dicaprio character shadowy past i would describe the first third of the movie as trying to understand what the is going on the middle third as you continuously sitting on the edge of your seat this is a figure of speech but i actually did this and the final third of you trying to work out how the film will conclude those who have seen shutter island will understand what i mean when i say this the final shot of the two films are very similar not quite showing you enough to know what will happen next but leaving the ending as a very open cliffhanger anyway i highly recommend this movie to those who have an open mind and do not complain if they do not understand the whole thing because anyone can understand the best parts of this movie one of dicaprio finest ,8

en,912747377,inception has received almost unanimously good reviews in the press so who am i to say as an ordinary paying member of the filmgoing public that this movie is a dog i have to qualify that i left after the first hour or so during the gunfight sorry that not very clear during the yellow cab gunfight to distinguish it from all the other gunfights i really have better things to do with my time even writing this back to the movie or half of it anyway dreams within dreams within dreams do not have to be logical i suppose they would not be dreams if they were but a story should be logical or at least be capable of explanation and this one is not from a screenplay point of view it just did not hang together for me the episodic nature of the story such as it is made no sense whatsoever i realise that this was probably the intention and that presumably all would eventually become clear it just that i did not have the intestinal fortitude to sit through to the end almost every utterance by the characters seemed to come out of thin air with no relevance to anything else the innumerable fights lost all meaning and the undoubtedly clever gci effects appeared to me to be the sole reason for making the film in the first place hey let make a movie with cgi better than avatar those effects will be great can we build a storyline around them sorry the effects are good even if nothing like as stunning those in avatar but the complete lack of a halfway believable plot line just does not cut it for me as others have said the soundtrack did not help muffled dialogue and loud pretentious music do not mix but then again who cares the dialogue was truly mindbendingly banal sir michael you do not need the money do you please use a little discrimination when accepting roles two out of ten it would probably be one out of ten if i had been able to stick it to the end edited after i had posted this i looked for the first time at others reviews and noticed that dylan ##th july has used exactly the same summary as i there must be a clue there ,2

en,-1194374488,so after a lot of years of watching horror movies and loving horror movie adaptations of stephen king books i realised i had never watched misery after watching it i realised i should have took the time to watch it many years ago the story is about a writer who having finished a book decides to return home but on his return he has a accident and is rescued by his number one fan after that things take a dark twist while he is trying to recover from the accident the story in this film is brilliant and gripping you are always on edge of your seat wanting the main character to succeed its very believable which makes you fully emerged in the film the acting in this is brilliant and makes this film stand out james caan and kathy bates are so believable you genuinely hate but want to understand kathy bates character and you are constantly behind james caans character wanting him to succeed a great movies for horror and thriller fans worth a watch to anyone who interested in either genre ,8
en,691727019,the shining for kubrick is about the mystery of places and people the people staying at the overlook the torrances but also the overlook and the sense of ghosts who perhaps know all too well their accursed fate it also a work of mad genius cribbing king book which was scary and moody on its own if heavy on exposition for the sake of giving a viewer a sense of total and unnerving dread it perhaps also a really great ordinary people are not what they seem saga and about writing and jack nicholson with nicholson performance by the way it meant to be such a giant performance and it either gets to you or it does not this is a big performance that ranks with the likes of a noh theater production as if nicholson had a touch of mifune in throne of blood surrounded by those ghosts of macbeth we only gets hints about this man sanity early on then his growing boredom and then a sense of really what the hell is going on with this guy in the book it made much more explicit the hotel gotten to him it in fact taken him over in order to get to the boy in the movie you cannot be sure of it because kubrick and nicholson keep you guessing even as what you see is what you think you got also shelley duvall is underrated here it a performance that perhaps not as great as nicholson but that because she wendy is not the one the hotel gets to at least in the same way it does for jack torrance it an exagerration of what one would expect a normal everyday mother who also happens to live with and brush aside domestic abuse and alcoholism or try to bear with is as she can to react in this environment it was said kubrick pushed duvall quite hard during the production and it shows for all the best effect in fact the shining film would not be so great if it were not for pushing hard against what is possible it taps into the soul of the book but translates for a medium that needs spatial sense the thread of ambiguity which can be a no no for some filmmakers but for kubrick is nothing short of mandatory while presenting us with really disturbing things it not particularly a film to show to a nine year old but i saw it when i was nine anyway and was moved confused running out of the house freaked out woman in bathtub seriously and knowing deep down i was experiencing some visceral thing here the camera the little girls the music the all work and no play the hedge maze nicholson all of it comes together in one of those ultimate tales that makes perfect sense and no sense at all it also gives the chance to ask questions which the book as amazing as it is did not let you do film as a medium gets a brooding kick in the nuts by the shining ,10
en,1709555887,yet another masterpiece from the marvel film franchise some people went in the theaters being on either team cap or team iron man but by the end of the film it clear no one was sure which side to be on the film presents events people and confrontations that justifies each and every avenger motivations for choosing a side they are all valid and understandable tony stark wants to make amends for the damage he and his fellow avengers have caused other people worried that he wo not be able to stop which leads him to sign over his suit to the government to control when they decide steve rodgers on the other hand is distrustful of the government which can be manipulated and corrupted by criminals like the hydra and maintains that the safest hands are still their own after a series of disasters involving steve friend bucky the two camps get into a confrontation at an airport this is one of the best fight sequences ever as we get to see all of the avengers plus two new faces black panther and spiderman use their various and unique skills against each other the psychological aspects betrayal friendship and revenge and lessons on morality make this a unique film and with each avenger given enough screen time this is a blockbuster you do not want to miss ,9
en,1709555887,this film is a masterpiece in super hero genre almost every character there was well constructed the film is well paced the action scenes were great the story was simple yet well presented even when spider man was introduced it did not ruin the film pacing or made his insertion seem forced black panther may be a bit of a disappointment in the beginning but as the character develops he gets much better and matures more than tony stark the villain he was not even necessary and yet did what he had to do some of the characters question the whole new law thing and start thinking about their actions in recent events it not like the comics but for me it seems that the director and the script writer did everything they could with the resources they had i know that giving it a ## may be a bit of an exaggeration for some people because there are better films than this one but for me in the super hero genre this one is the best so far ,9
en,1709555887,captain america civil war review #### the year of shitty election movies this goes a step further however it an embodiment of almost everything that wrong with a majority of big budget blockbusters the movie gets going with an explosive action sequence with god knows how many cuts per second it was like the polar opposite of just about every scene in alfonso cuar n children of men these cuts are designed to cover up the fact that the stunt team are a bunch of amateurs but forget the action sequence it the aftermath that matters all the civilians these so called heroes have wasted and so begins a film that completely bashes its audience over the head with its blatant political messages now of course with a movie like this there got to be some sort of third party involved a definite villain because apparently subjective interpretation is bad this particular mastermind was only really there however to bash us further over the head with the film themes needless to say their motive was incredibly predictable and they made the third act of this movie a slog with a film this ridiculous the filmmakers have to find ways to show the audience that they are not supposed to take it too seriously the way they do this is they insert a ton of really awkward punchlines what they really need to understand is that there this thing called nuance and say tweaking the color palette would qualify as it unfortunately there are still corny ass scenes in the film particularly ones that involve iron man robert downey jr ### minutes of patronizing pandering garbage # ##,3
en,1474345136, note to readers these comments are written specifically for those who have already seen memento i would recommend you see the film without reading this or any other review of the film save the reviews for later or you will kill off one of the enjoyable aspects of seeing this film in particular i will be giving a lot away in the following paragraphs there has been a lot of discussion about the gimmick in memento i e the backwards progression of the scenes some like it some do not but i think this is one of the few instances in which it works what better way is there to get the audience to ride along with the character than to put you in the same position by not knowing what came right before we are forced to struggle with leonard predicament rather than simply watch it i think that it is interesting how i began feeling sympathy for leonard from the very beginning here was a guy who clearly has a horrible handicap instead of not trusting my true instincts i believed that he could overcome his handicap simply by leaving himself notes and being organized i found myself believing him and believe in him in hindsight i wonder how i could allow myself to let my guard down so much of course i should not believe this guy he simply puts ideas together based on a couple of notes that absurd yet it is only during the course of the film that i developed questions i think it is a testament to the filmmaker that i can be drawn in like that perhaps it the character sincerity and confidence finally there have been criticisms of how this film leaves people confused with questions and without closure some people like closure in their films and i do too when it appropriate however i feel there are some instances where you simply will never know the truth i believe that in films that revolve around those situations the lack of closure is not only acceptable but preferable while some amateur reviewers particularly on this website have coined memento a great breakthrough in filmmaking and one of the greatest thrillers ever i think that is an exaggeration it a very good film that i recommend seeing but i think there are about # ## films a year that are this good that said i am implying that it will likely end up in my top # or ## for the year so i clearly liked it ,9
en,1474345136,very well crafted film this first impression it made on me was how complex it was to write and edit without looking cheesy or inconsistent christopher nolan memento carefully threads a forward moving black and white narration of the reasons the storyline events unfold in the way and order which explains the color portion of the film which is showed in retrospect does that make sense watch the movie and it will this complex film has a very simple premise guy pierce character leonard is out to avenge his wife killer thats it but wait this film is shown in a pseudo jeopardy game format where the answer is given first and the questions are yet to unfold the scenes are edited in a terrentino style and pulp fictionesse kind of way whereby you are given vignettes of events which at first do not make sense until you see the plot unfold after the fact the fact that leonard cannot store any new information into his short term memory gives way to how difficult everyday things are to remember for him but also how dedicated he is to solve this murder mystery when you cannot remember what he did ten minutes ago this gives this movie an intriguing storyline the film starts at the end and slowly devolves into explaining what was shown in the very opening the fading photograph is a great metaphor for how the rest of the film is going to devolve and unfold the details after the fact the only saving grace for leonard is that he remembers someone sammy jenkins that he once investigated who had the same mental condition that he has sammy jenkins had provided the road map to the process leonard needed in order to solve this mystery as he moved through the storyline the only saving grace from leonard is that he learned first hand from sammy jenkins that you got to have a system to make it work this is how leonard is able to track and find his wife killer through the use of the process of writing everything down and photographing people and places this process was learned prior to his wife death and was still in his long term memory leonard kept permanent notes tattooed to his body in order to keep from losing them when questioned about his method of keeping his information leonard defends his system by saying by writing down facts i remember but memory can change a car to a van or the shape of a room leonard impresses upon the viewer that his process of orientation is the most efficient and only possible way he can put the pieces together to track down his villain the director uses a telephone conversation which moves in a forward direction against the retro tide of the color portion of the devolving film to explain the events that are showing in a retrospective play by play sequence of events this telephone conversation is filled with all recalled information which is the only information that is store in his head leonard speaks on the telephone in a very lucid and fluid way which never gave the impression that he had a memory disability at all this black and white narration explains the process leonard uses as learned from sammy jenkins jenkins taught leonard to learn not by memory but by instinct it is leonards past experiences in his long term memory and his instinct as an investigator is what takes him to his wife killer great movie i need to see it again to test the truths of the movie very much like the movie the sixth sense ,9
en,1474345136,memento is one of the smartest films ever conceived no question its base story about a man hunt for his wife killer is certainly not original but the way it is told here certainly is and it uses an incredible plot device to make it work even better guy pearce is lenny shelby a man suffering short term memory less cannot make new memories his wife was raped and murdered and all he has are fragmented clues about what happened and who responsible his problem is that because his memory last about # minutes he repeatedly forgets who he just met what he just did where he just been consequently he tattoos apparent facts to his body to remind him of the truth and photographs everyone he engages with as a memento of them and to enable him to identify them later this is only half the genius of this story the other half is equally if not more brilliant the story is told in reverse it starts at the end and makes its way to the beginning but it because shelby does not remember anything and of course we do that makes the narrative flow superbly the core idea is vengeance and trust who is he after and who should he trust to help find them the editing in memento is absolute genius and somehow it all makes perfect sense and works succinctly it is one of the most satisfying films to sit back and admire the structure of in terms of performances pearce pantoliano teddy and moss natalie are decent if uninspiring none of them are particularly personable but that more down to the nature of the story than bad acting pearce does lack charisma but again you could accuse his character condition of being the reason it is difficult to say more without spoiling the plot i will merely recommend if you have not seen one then you should superbly original film making ,10
en,1474345136,in this stylish thriller noir british director chris nolan delivers a film that is original and intriguing the films core is based on one man weakness with his mind leonard shelby guy pearce is after his wife killer unfortunately he is a man who has a rare memory disorder this leaves him with no short term memory thus highly unlikely to solve the case leonard has tattoos on his body and post it notes stuck to things so he can remember important clues and daily rituals it is imaginative and original ideas like these which make the film a refreshing experience for anyone who is interested in seeing it he has friends that want to help him solve the case natalie carrie ann moss and teddy joe pantoliano although no one is who they seem and everyone plays an integral part in the story the film does not use traditional narrative instead it relies on the viewers high level of concentration throughout after seeing the film twice i still have ideas in my head and have spent hours analyzing it to come to the conclusion that it is a fresh film that give its cast and crew a lot of potential to do well in the future ,10
en,-1668490575,a rather delightful film hilarious and clever with the odd vulgar joke now and again i doubt that the kids will get all the jokes some of it assumes prior knowledge but they will love the motley of fairy tale characters my favourite character must be the donkey and his non stop chatter while watching this i was reminded of another film with similar intentions the princess bride to say that the two films are alike would be misleading but shrek certainly has resonances of the earlier film the same kind of tongue in cheek references to fairy tales that we know and love so well a very funny and touching film ,9
en,-1668490575,one of the best movies ever and definitely the best in its genre impressive computer graphics excellent design funny story and multilevel jokes what else do you need and add a bunch of talented actors as a bonus a must see must have and must recommend i have seen it twice and waiting to buy the dvd ,10
en,-1668490575,i doubt if many people will think this is the absolute funniest movie they have ever seen however it may be the funniest movie ever on universal appeal little kids were laughing grey haired ladies were laughing some big biker dude was laughing my wife was doubled over in tears we missed many lines in the movie because the whole theater was roaring no this is not a thick plot the characters will not endure tremendous growth or tragedy but that not what they were trying to do here they were making a silly roller coaster laugh your butt off kind of movie and they did that very well murphy and myers were very funny without being lewd i commend them for that for a bunch of good laughs for every one in the family including your hard to please teenager shrek is a must see there were things happening in the movie that were so absurd and wacky that everyone had no choice but to laugh go see enjoy ,10
en,-1668490575,i cannot understand the praise this movie gets it very derivative of most cartoon movies tv shows of today the animation is spectacular but that is not enough the movie just is not funny or interesting the jokes are all low brow and recycled the plot is the usual fairy tale stuff just with a little irony thrown in to make the film appear hip look this wink wink nudge nudge use of self aware irony in kids movies was tired years ago enough already we understand that you the film makers are clever fine but do not try to remind us of that every # seconds this movie just is not worth the time it takes to watch it there are countless other better animated movies to see avoid ,4
en,-1306513742,i had to give this title a ## and i have never done this before i literally guessed wrongly the plot ending storyline etc five different times the first time i watched it needless to say i was pleasantly surprised as the story wrapped up and i needed no more reel time to satisfy me i watched it again immediately afterward to be only more in touch with all the details of the story of ben thomas the character who will smith plays ben is a complex man with an agenda that we see as heartless at times and full of grace all others this is a love story a story of forgiving a tragedy and a blessing all wrapped up into a neat little package that all people will enjoy the first hour plus of storyline is character building in its finest and i am grateful it was there at the time it seemed like the story would never start only to find out i was already living it go see this movie tell your friends seven pounds will be one to have in your personal collection for years to come ,10
en,-1306513742,i was lucky i came to this knowing nothing about it for some odd reason i had avoided the press and those trailers that tell you the whole story as a result i was able to simply flow with the story the way the writer intended not knowing what was coming next i had the full mystery that complex of mysteries that were set out for us i found the writing amazingly deep sure there are what would be called deep themes love redemption and both in novel forms but its the way the thing is unfolded for us that i find so special will smith does not annoy me he a sort of everyman token like jimmy stewart or better fred macmurray he does well enough his true value here was in discovering the story and assembling the team a competent enough team the story is by itself enough for me to recommend this to you the cinematic treatment is something else though it could have been magnificent it could have been eviscerating it could have encircled your heart there were lots of hooks written in simply for the camera that business with the jellyfish is a visual setup smoky and translucent the concept of the auditor who sees through the idea of the communication via texting that leads to disaster the message gone wrong the idea of love as a bodily giving the notion of brotherhood allowed via waiting outside these are the things that cinema was invented for it has been ready for material like this for eons someone needs to transplant this in a stronger body someone needs to be the embossed printer ted evaluation # of # worth watching ,10
en,-1046617570,firstly i want to say that it was a hearth warming movie it is possible to get a couple of good cries in there even though i did not cry because i am a manly man it tells the story of a rich guy who had a stroke during paragliding accident and a guy from the projects that becomes his care giver french projects are designed to move the poor out of the city so that they can make trouble elsewhere their success is questionable as far as i know this movie is based on a true story and for some reason it makes the movie more compelling for me if in the beginning it says that it is based on a true story i correct my posture clear my throat and give my full attention and do not get me even started with the pictures they show afterwards i immediately googled them and like i always do got amazed by how similar they look i wonder if the woman who the rich guy married is the women that he was letter pals with even though it was a typical unexpected friendship movie it was fun to watch the opera scene was classic like the shave scene i must admit i also do those with my beard the sad thing is i do it every single time i shave they could have shown the care giver life a bit more i think ,8
en,-1046617570,the intouchables begins with the disoriented action of an elderly white aristocrat being driven at thrilling pace through paris in a maserati by a strikingly tall omar sy as they devilishly evade arrest following a high speed police pursuit the narrative then returns in time to establish this relationship which cleverly exploits the unlikely friendship clich which would otherwise be presumed by the audience as tired before commencement the acting of both francis and omar combines to carry the realism and humanity upon which this magnificent film is grounded in the incredibly dynamic portrayal of a mutual sense of humour which acted as the primary catalyst between philippe and driss is testament to the level of artistry deserving of all awards they received for their performance ludovico einaudi has done a magnificent job at creating a score that not only sounds realistic itself but brings classical profundity and a very french grandeur in to contrast with the very down to earth themes of friendship and raw human nature cinematically flawless the urban landscape of driss hometown becomes equally visually appealing as the aristocratic parties and over decorated sweeping hallways of philippe mansion long lens portraiture on wet paris streets with dancing bokeh consistently delivers as cinematography explores both the romance and cold edginess of the city colour palate while the intouchables delivers in all sections of production and narrative value the story lacked legitimacy and depth when delving into the life of driss and at times felt slightly tokenistic and perhaps too evidently conceived from high budget production despite the lack of a grungy social representation that maybe i wrongly expected i vote this film as just short of absolute brilliance ,8
en,769743543,whenever i read about what a great movie citizen kane is i am reminded of the story of the king who wore invisible clothes the king had this suit of clothes made which the tailor said could only be seen by honest people in fact there were no clothes but the tailor relied on no one admitting that they could not see them so as the king paraded by everyone commented on how lovely the king new clothes were though they could see nothing finally a child pointed to the king and said but he has no clothes he naked and everyone understood that they were not dishonest people but that the king was a dunce that exactly how i feel about this movie everyone says this movie is the greatest thing since sliced bread and i think half of them simply do not want other to think they are artistically challenged a remaining fourth have been convinced that they do like it even though down at the bone they do not and the rest really see something good in the film i have tried repeatedly to find merit with this movie because everyone else says it so good so they must be right and i must be wrong i have studied the reviews and looked for all the devices within the movie that supposedly make it so great but i have come to one conclusion the king is really naked ,2

en,673888960,tonight was one of those night i had gone to the movies just because i wanted to no specific title in mind i get there and the illusionist which i had heard nothing about except that it had been compared to the prestige as they were both about magic i went not knowing what to expect and for most of the movie the plot seemed very linear and although it had many good parts it was nothing amazing and then spoiler alert the ending started at first i did not understand what was going on what the the orange tree business meant and then as the images started to flow i started to understand i am majoring in movie directing and i have an insight in some of the most used tricks in the business and i usually catch on pretty fast but here the director was so good at hot and cold showers i swallowed everything line hook everything he tells time and time again in the movie that it all fake it a trick it nothing but that and in the meantime he convinces you that you are witnessing real magic that he a sorcerer instead of a magician but the trick is what the director pulls on the audience when the titles started rolling nobody got up to leave and i mean nobody i was happy all the way to the car just glad to have been made a fool of because really is not that why we all go to the movies to believe ,10

en,-1170046782,loved batman begins then it seems like christopher nolan lost his love if he ever had it for the source material i am a huge batman fan and will give any adaptation my full support i can usually get something out of it the more i watch the # dark knight movies the more i hate them and the more i think that nolan was never a batman fan the stories are poorly thought out but that not exactly nolan fault it how he introduces our heroes and villains that make me question his passion for the projects in a scene that looks like it was shot by my older brother and his friends with a ## video camera batman is introduced only after seeing a few pathetic batman copycats then we see him running through a parkade after a car he is indistinguishable at this point from the copycats not how i wanna be reintroduced to my favorite comic book character in a fluorescent lit parkade uncertain if it even him where the mystique wheres the darkness the mythos where the fear he supposed to bring with him it all washed out the second bad entrance was with the most significant villain in comic book lore the joker i know everybody loves heath r i p but i cannot approve of his portrayal firstly the joker the joker is introduced when he casually walks into a scene reminiscent of a scene out of dick tracy where a bunch of corny campy bad guys exchange dialogue in what is supposed to be a meeting of gotham underworld kings then some nobody strolls into this basement with his henchmen like a background character might does some tongue acting then puts the screws to the crime bosses with no opposition how did the joker even find out about this meeting and how was he allowed to waltz in with no charisma might i say where the evil where the man behind the face paint where the unbridled lunacy the key to a good villain is that you want to hate him but you cannot help but love him i could not find the joker a joker any joker in any minute of ledgers performance his characters ability to predict the multitude of variables that had to occur for his plan to go off is unbelievable even for the truest of believers agent of chaos or not i need my joker to be somewhat grounded connected to something to have some motivation some cause for his direction i have already been lambasted by the people around me so i understand if this review will upset people im happy there are so many die hard passionate dark knight fans but i have to state what is so obvious to me shot for shot this is a train wreck oldmans comatose performance as gordon the purposeless tacked on fight scene near the end of the movie all of it just cannot do it it plot is challenging in many ways absolutely stupid in most others no rendition will ever ruin batman for me but the follow up dark knight rises which i also hated cemented to me the lack of love on nolan part ,1

en,-1170046782,i saw the dark knight shortly after it was released to theaters i had not seen batman begins the movie to which this is a sequel i was not the biggest fan of comic book movies i liked movies that were compelling as well as intelligent and at least marginally high class i expected little though some of my friends described the film as life changing and it was the number one rated in imdb at the time it was spectacular the film went above and beyond my expectations it did not have the feel of a comic book movie at all but rather that of an epic one did not need to see batman begins to understand it the acting especially that of heath ledger was outstanding there were no plot holes that i could find and the plot itself was replete with surprises the action rivaled that of any thriller making the picture seem much shorter than it really was two and a half hours and the characters lived their lives and suffered through their experiences genuinely i was astounded i have seen it so many times that i have lost track to this day and love it no less i still jump at some parts contrary to popular belief it was not gory though there were some disturbing images bravo ten and beyond out of ten ,10
en,-1170046782,all my reviews are rather late because i cannot stand crowds you see i am claustrophobic in a crowded theater i just keep looking at the red exit signs that the first thing i wanted to say but please read on you might find this interesting i ate up the knight trailers it a given i am going to see the sequel to batman begins that was an excellent movie jump starting that franchise after a sickening piece of bat guano like batman and robin was no mean feat although i am usually a big clooney fan so this is a trailer review like everyone else i focused on the joker because the actor who played him died i am sorry that he will not be alive and making movies anymore i loved him to pieces in the knight trailer nicholson was absolutely wunderbar in the kiddies version of batman but in the present existentialist mood of the franchise the new joker is i believe right on target the movie is still a batman movie it going biff boom ker pow splat and bang all over the place groovy gadgets abound nolan which i agree is a very good actor is all wrapped up in his cool looking now manageable full body condom and his bat angst and this is a good sequel to a batman movie with a budget in the high gazillions right then there that maniac who plays the joker in a trailer that tries its damnedest not to be too joker centric he is just fabulous someone teased his hair and stuck about twenty cent worth of gunk in it then they applied about a dollar worth of red black and white clown makeup to his face the off color clothes you could buy at any thrift shop for say twenty bucks hire a tailor to jack up his shoulders pads in the back to give him a slightly hunchbacked look for thirty bucks let just say sixty bucks worth of joker ok the rest i believe will be pure genius i wanna see that i am hooked and i will add to this text when i have seen the movie ,10
en,-1170046782,the second christopher nolan batman movie marks an improvement on the first but only just the film like so many other comic book adaptations and action movies just tries to pack too much in and also suffers from the same achilles heel of a lot of modern films conscious of sequels it does not know where to end what ever happened to two guys having a fight and one of them dying the heath ledger performance rightly gains all the plaudits but his was the easiest part the supporting cast are strong with gary oldman particularly strong the film tries to introduce too many villains the original tim burton movie got it right one film one bad guy as a result all scenes without heath ledger seem like a distraction from the main attraction and for some reason christian bale puts on a dirty harry esquire rasp while donning the black cape the real same of the movie is that we do not see more of the bruce wayne character when mr bale puts on the stiff rubber suit his acting becomes stiffer great comic book movie yes great movie no ,10
en,-1170046782,everything was spot on in this movie the acting by heath ledger the music the camera shots the stunts and most importantly the writing i did have a few problems with the movie such as things that did not explain themselves properly like when the joker told batman where harvey and rachel was but he ended up in a completely different place that was not explained very well there is theories on that however the start of the movie where the joker planned the bank robbery and had everyone kill each other in order to later have the money and burn it all that also was not explain why he did it and the reason behind it like the amount of times the joker gave a different story to whenever he talked about his scars i have seen this movie so many times since it came out it really comes down to nitpicking i highly suggest anyone to watch this movie because it truly is for the acting alone a masterpiece ,10
en,-1170046782,christopher nolan teaches a great lesson here how to make a nearly perfect piece of cinamatic art based on a comic book the recipe is a magneficant actor for the main villain no need to praise that one could argue that heath ledger got overrated after his early death he truly gives a great performance here he portrays the menacing chaotic psycopath in a way that old time batman fan boys like myself watch the movie over and over just to see him again the story shell is nothing new however it all coherent the atmosphere throughout the movie never fails to keep the watchers at the edge of their seats the characters are bar one to me all believable and fit in gotham city and the atmosphere perfectly a great actor is also needed for the title role christian bale is the best batman yet not that val kilmer or george clooney set the standards too high terrific musics and noises a deep disturbing melody or rhythm is always on in the background this manages to somehow darken the atmosphere even more last but not least astounding visuals nothing over the top the stunts explosions etc fit in the story well and almost everything is believable the # small think i did not like are the chick who is simply not beautiful enough for her role two face character which is pretty lame and could have made for an other whole movie and the #d sonar goggles mr freeman gave to batman which in my opinion were only a tool to show off some nice #d graphics while being a little bit ridiculous # ## for me a must see for every batman fan and action movie fan in general ,9
en,-1170046782,first of all what a wonderful performance from heath ledger he immersed himself totally in the role as the joker a much more sinister and psychotic portrayal than jack nicholson #### performance which was also excellent was his performance alone good enough to propel this film to number one on the imdb website absolutely not do not believe the hype michael caine morgan freeman and gary oldman are veterans of the screen and are very easy to watch christian bale as batman was quite ordinary this time around and i imagine his throat was very sore by the end of production with all the growling he did the character development of batman as a person was well thought out in batman begins we saw him face his fears and conquer them something very much at the heart of authentic martial arts training and provided an insight into the character we as the audience could relate to in the dark knight he appears too one dimensional his guilt at the death of innocent lives by the joker is for the most part portrayed by bland expressions and plenty of growling when disguised as batman maggie gyllenhaal was just plain bland as rachel dawes there did not seem to be much chemistry between herself and christian bale in the one romantic scene they had together i thought there was more chemistry with katie holmes and christian in batman begins i found myself nodding off when she had screen time with aaron eckhart thankfully the director must have reviewed her lack luster performance up to this point and decided the only option left was to blow her up aaron eckhart performance as harvey dent was for the most part quite bland also but improved somewhat after becoming two face his scene in the hospital with heath ledger was his one saving grace the hand to hand combat was quite ordinary in tdk with batman being a practitioner of ninjutsu there was no dynamic display of technique to marvel at or the subtleties of subterfuge psychological like in batman begins for which this art is known to employ the film dragged at the end and needed to finish half an hour earlier overall heath carries the film with his performance but there was a lot in the film that felt disjointed and not up to par with the original ,6
en,-1170046782,i attended the movie last night in a crowded screen where everyone was literally hugging each other shows what advertising does for the film seen as the first one was such a undercover success before i start i am not showing any disrespect to the late heath or any other character in this film i am just presenting my opinion on why the hype did not compare in the first film we see gotham presented as a dark city corrupt under the power of its mob and this is emphasised where ever we go in the city almost the whole movie was shot in a sort of shroud of eeriness to represent the bad and evil around great piece of cinematography in dk dark knight we see the city very bright and almost looks like this bad has been rid of which i can believe as a good thing because as we find the city is being cleaned up by harvey dent it just does not look like it was meant to be for that though oh and where was the proper wayne tower from the first one because as far as i can remember it was in tact when we left the first one be now on to characters first christian bale i think christian is a very talented actor from seeing him in other undercover success such as the prestige the machinist and of course batman begins i simply thought that we did not see enough of him in this film with him being the protagonist i thought we were not as close to him as in batman begins it was almost as though we were watching from a different perspective all together maggie gyllenhaal i have got to say i was so happy when she died in this film i decided to give her chance when it first started but she did not suck me in to the character of rachel dawes like katie holmes did and i was disappointed to hear she had other arrangements when she was asked to appear in this aaron eckhart who played harvey dent i thought played the villain two face a lot better than he did dent he seemed to make the two face character his own like the touch heath gave joker michael caine and morgan freeman played their parts greatly just like they always do in any film i have ever seen there parts fit them so well as well both coming out with their useful comments every now and again to help push the dark crusader onwards sort of like the agony aunts of batman finally coming to the late heath ledger i suppose seen as i could not believe that it was him under that paint that he must of done a pretty good job i think though that some people are being whats the word well their opinion of the film is being blinded by his performance and his death gotta have a huge amount of respect for him seen as he was in lords of dogtown and played his part amazingly great actor overall and its been a tragedy to lose him so quickly now to the storyline to be honest when i heard that it was two and half hours long i was even more pumped to see it seen as i love long films the opening bank seen i thought was really good because that is what the joker would do so was very capturing for his character sort of settled the mood to then the rest of the way through the film i felt rushed without a chance to get settled down with what was going on it felt like an episode of cribs where the cameras just constantly in a new place i know a bit ott but i thought it was funny i did like how rachel was killed off in the middle though and not only because she was annoying but because it unravelled a good story line of two face and bruce taking the pain of his loss and putting it on the side line some of the story line was very predictable which i did not enjoy and then some of it was very wild like harvery as two face i thought that the two face should of been the ending so that it left it in suspense for the next one i also thought the mob were presented as a bit of a wuss crowd in this one especially eric roberts who played the falconey representative he just seemed like a complete joke compared to falconey in the last one did anyone notice the gambler as well they should not waste characters like they did with this plus they made him look rubbish i can always remember him as more of doing guy personally it might have been the hype that ruined it for me please do not post that missed heath ledger as well when you did not know him this is why i feel it was not great if you agree with some of the ideas i posted post it as helpful if you think i did not present anything good vote unhelpful thanks for your time and as if anthony michael hall was in it i did not realise it was him ,7
en,-199935291,the movie was great sean penn performance was awesome he should definitely win an award for this one this movie is definitely a chick flick go with a bunch of girls you will really appreciate it and do not forget to bring the tissue box ,10
en,-109112117,it is very seldom that a film can weave a tale that is so boring violent and completely unbelievable that one cannot even get past the story to be able to assess the other elements of that film ie acting cinematography sound etc this was that film i do not even know if denzel washington or ethan hawke turned in good performances i could not get my mind past the question why did denzel say yes to this piece of trash must have been for the money i know that they got my and my wife ## bucks and i want it back i think that this was supposed to be a graphic slice of life flick but the plot twists and random ironies were so ridiculous that suspending disbelief was impossible best to let this one gather dust on the back shelves of the video store ,10
en,-109112117,i always liked denzel since he was in a solider story but he is truly showing the public he has talent you never know what is going to happen next or what side denzel is really on ethan hawk was also good as the unsuspecting want to be save the world cop denzel gets my vote for an oscar as well as the writers and directors everyone needs to see denzel as he has never been seen before who would believe that all this action takes place in just one day what a day ,10
en,-2084877108,there are a few words that come to mind with this movie amazing breath taking incredible and supercalifrajilisticexpialidocious are some but even those do not really get it across if you have not seen this movie please do yourself a favor and do so before you die i wish i had more space to go on and on about the colossal achievement this movie set forth the cgi gollum set a higher standard for computer engineering today along with the trolls and oliphaunts the score flies not another word for it and i cannot even count how many times i cried the most heart wrenching line do not go where i cannot follow i could not find a flaw in anything this movie won its half a million exageration oscars for when you see it you cannot wonder for even a second that it won so many of course being the mini simon cowell i am i do have a few points to pick first off i do not really find much to complain about the few things that were left out the scouring of the shire i knew right off was not going to be in the movie i mean people have just finished watching this huge epic war and now it finally over a sensible director would not start an entire other battle right at the end i know i would not the houses of healing was a little disappointing because you really wanted to see eowyn with faramir just to finish off the entire picture but i have not seen the extended version yet so i am crossing my fingers however some of the things that were in the movie were a little iffy denethor pyre was something i have been looking forward to ever since i read the books it always been my favorite part i end up reading that chapter over and over however in the movie some of the things that really got at you in the book were left out the part with his hands forever emblazoned on the palantir gave me shivers and although watching a fiery body plunge off the wall is a very cool shot it did not do much for me i missed the goosebumps the book had always given me and i felt like that as something that could have used those few extra minutes of time on if anything also the pippin and the palantir scene was a bit strange the entire motion blur would have been fine if it was another movie but compared to the rest of lotr it just was not up to par i could not help but laugh when i saw it which i am sure was not the point of the scene however put those two sort of bad things together pippin and denethor scenes and what do you get pippin all shall fade scene which takes the cake for tear jerkers so you see even if there is that one little gripe like there is in all films the movie as a whole as an emotion makes up for everything in conclusion even if you are a nit picker like me this film is one that will go down in movie history you do not need to be a tolkein fan or even have read the books to appreciate its majesty ,10
en,-2084877108,the return of the king was by far the best movie i have ever seen in my entire life the entire # and a half hours that i was sitting in the theatre i was blindly captivated by the film the return of the king is even better then the first two the entire movie was done with such state of the art special effects that your eyes will be thanking you when the movies over there were so many on the edge of your seat scenes that i kept on finding myself falling out of my seat in the theatre this film is a true work of art and deserves an academy award i dont want to spoil any of the film for you so all i can see is see the return of the king you wont regret it ## out of ##,10
en,-2084877108,what a wonderful movie there was a lot of straying from the book that i was disappointed in but it was still an awesome film i realize that it would be impossible for everything to be put into the film i just feel that a bunch of loose ends were never tied up but it still has become my favorite of the series ,10
en,-2084877108,i was incredibly happy with the way peter jackson did the last installment of lord of the rings he kept all the major plot occurences from the book and transformed them into a visual presentation of the book the ending was so parallel to the boo kthat it had near the same affect of instilling emotion into me as the book did therefore i think that rotk is one of the best movies this year and in the history of filmmaking ,10
en,-2084877108,peter jackson has achieved the impossible with the lord of the rings trilogy he has crafted a motion picture that is not only technically perfect but visually mind blowing and immensely entertaining in every respect and what is more jackson has not only accomplished this feat once but three times in a row the fellowship of the ring and the two towers were exciting breathtakingly beautiful motion pictures and the return of the king is no different like its predecessors return is rich with dazzling special effects a haunting melodic score and hundreds of amazingly well choreographed battle sequences all set against the stunning backdrop of rural new zealand the series flows seamlessly from one film to the next yet each film stands on its own as a unique original work of cinematic art in the return of the king frodo and sam carry on their trek to mount doom to dispose of the one ring while a seemingly endless war for the future of middle earth rages on around them meanwhile aragorn legolas and gimli all venture to the cursed mountains to seek assistance from the lost souls who forever dwell there as the beautiful elfin queen arwen is torn between her father wishes of joining her people for eternal life and her own desire to sacrifice her immortality in order to be with aragorn there a lot going on in the lord of the rings films and unless you are already familiar with the story i was not it can be difficult to keep track of the many characters and subplots broken down the lord of the rings storyline is nothing more than a good versus evil tale albeit a complex multilayered one the pacing is suitably evenhanded allotting equal amounts of screen time to the various colorful characters and journeys taking place within middle earth the return of the king never once falls into the trap of showing too much or too little of a certain subplot and it never progresses too far without providing ample information about what is taking place elsewhere though i was impressed with virtually every facet of the rings trilogy what strikes me most about these films is jackson astounding attention to detail every shot is impeccably executed right down to the last frame the set design costumes weaponry and even the traits and mannerisms of the different races of characters are perfectly and meticulously conceived the amount of time and dedication invested into these films is truly unfathomable just take a look at the credits the computer generated characters are some of the most impressive i have ever seen particularly the subtle movements and detailed facial expressions of gollum however the cg creatures still lack the naturalism of organic movement and at times their interaction with human characters seems too obviously staged there a certain fluid overly smooth quality of their movement that makes it seem artificial we certainly have come a long way in the field of computer animation but we still have quite a ways to go to combine it with live action and make it seem completely believable this is not to say that the cg in lord of the rings is not great just that it not perfect still it probably as close to perfection as is humanly possible at this point the return of the king swept the academy awards in #### raking in a well deserved unprecedented eleven oscars not bad for a guy whose first foray into feature film making was a low budget gorefest about flesh eating aliens ,10
en,-2084877108,well the trilogy has ended and it time for some conclusions first of all return of the king is imo not as good as fellowship of the ring on the other hand it definitely better than the two towers which i think is by far the weakest of the three films all in all return of the king is certainly a good film but it too long the battle scenes somewhat lack intensity and when it all over you are left with this lingering was that it do not get me wrong i like the film but it does feel as something of an anti climax perhaps it simply not possible to transfer the enormity and intensity of what is meant to take place to film the battle scenes are a bit dull they lack intensity and realism which is too bad because the battle scenes are in many ways the most important part of the film to make it all worse at least as i see it they try to make up for it with slapstick kill count and silly comments from gimli who is again reduced to comic relief as well as a tendency to focus on the really big stuff tm oliphants various trolls and the big siege weapons instead of really following the battle also i find the constant switching between frodo and sam and the battles annoying because it breaks up the battle scenes jerking you out of the action just as it starting to pull you in rotk simply does not do a good enough job of making you feel the intensity of battle some movies can almost make you smell the blood rotk does not achieve that in fact there hardly any blood at all and often just a lot of cgi i guess the pg## rating did not help in that department cgi has come far but battle scenes are still vastly better with real people anyway most of the movie is pretty good but it never quite achieves lift off before it touches down on the ground again as with the matrix trilogy the sequels just do not quite live up to the first although i will say again that i think rotk is a good although not brilliant movie and definitely better than two towers there no reason not to watch this film and i am almost certain it wo not be as good on dvd as it is on the big screen mostly because the cgi and fx are so important so go see it in a cinema while you have the chance if you say this is the best movie you have ever seen however and it almost a law of nature that some people will whenever a new lotr flick is out i suggest you see some more movies yes i find all the lotr fanboys and girls who uncritically love the movies with a zeal unmatched even by the most die hard religious fundamentalists extremely annoying ,7

en,2117497550,note i had not had my french press coffee and croissant yet when i wrote this so eloquent it ai not enjoy my review i saw it last night at a screening in philly hundreds of people showed up and got turned away many were furious complete chaos a woman who thought i worked at the theater let out a string of cuss words at me i do not really feel like giving a detailed well written review but i thought it was marvelous and look forward to seeing it again the pros eddie remayne passionate performance and worthy of recognition amanda seyfried really makes cosette something special the young cosette was a perfect match for seyfried and that little girl gave a lot of great moments especially in the thenardier waltz of treachery cohen and carter were wonderful and their final moment was the funniest part of the film the scenes in paris to the finale were the highlights the kid who played gavroche was fantastic and i finally like that character now i would love to see that kid get some recognition javert final moment was unexpected and frighting very powerful also loved the factory ladies anne hathaway i actually enjoyed at the end more than the beginning honestly i found the film to be straight forward and relatively gimmick free many plot holes and wrinkles in the stage show were ironed out here such as the students complete isolation at the barricades the business with marius ring valjean superhuman strength as he drags marius through the sewers etc and finally hugh jackman deserves an oscar nomination a win would be great but i doubt that will happen but you are nuts if you think he wo not get a nod the cons poor russell crowe where was that gladiator this guy is a great actor and has given some great performances but he was just not even trying i am disappointed because i know he was capable of something much much better but he was not there and javert is so crucial it just sinks the story a bit to not having him be a part of the story the scenes up until paris seemed to drag a bit for me the heart and soul of les mis are always the barricade scenes master of the house was a great scene but a little restrained not the showstopper it could have been the freedom of the actors to dictate the underscoring is very jarring at first but you get used to it and accept it and it works and makes the movie better overall there was surprisingly too much restraint and realism for an epic film musical i mean hopper could have made it a little more fun you cannot take a musical too deadly serious i appreciate hooper desire to pull back but there were moments he could have really packed a punch but instead retreated overall i thought it was marvelous the movie is not better than the stage version and the stage version is not better than the movie if that makes sense they both work well together as companion pieces the tugging at the heartstrings that made the stage show so popular is still there tugging on your heartstrings in the movie theater i have not loved a film musical so much since chicago and honestly i think although chicago is a much much better work of art than les mis i was more frustrated with chicago the film than les mis the film interestingly russell crowe and richard gere were the weak links in both these movies i do not know how this will fare with oscar nominations or critics but i will say that this movie is going to be a gigantic hit with repeated viewings it makes you want to see it again because it is such a gigantic detailed movie tween girls will fall in love with marius and songs like on my own all over again and les mis the musical is going to have an enjoyable second life ultimately it a story about hope and there nothing wrong with that if you miss that when you see les mis you probably miss out on hope a lot ,8
en,-868504364,well i have read lots of reviews about this movie everyone talks about the two stories but no one talks about the very last scene but if am not mistaken the last scene in which before richard parker goes into the bushes surroundings are pale yellow brown but as soon as rp goes into it everything turns green so my assumption is rp is god and he was with pi all the time as far as #d effects are concerned i think they were ok nothing spectacular i have not read the book i am sure the last seen is not part of the book so its the interpretation of the director ,10
en,-868504364,i think this movie is a master piece in storytelling the opening is so calm and colorful and both idea of the film is shown first the animals are somehow like us second we the humans are somehow like them then the story goes and goes till the original story and the see trip we have been told two stories two good stories and both are unprovable then we should choose what story is better and we see that this is an irony because we find out that in the real life we should choose between two stories too and that is simply fascinating also the role of the principle animal tiger is very important in one story he honestly i did not know the tiger was either he or she but i say he because they called him richard parker is the main reason to keep awake the conciseness of pi and therefor to keep alive him in the other story he is the pi himself and what we see in first story is indeed the symbols of pi actions so the idea of animals are people and people are animals also narrated very well and cleverly in this movie i want say another two things one is that the idea of interchanging used in everywhere of life of pi like a canadian who come to french india in search of a story and l know an indian in french canada with the most incredible story to tell and the other thing is i saw all is lost before this movie and this two movies are so different with each other ,2
en,-868504364,thought i would write this down while it still fresh in my mind what struck me during the movie was how relevant it was to my own life especially with regards to my relationship with my husband beat seen through the eyes of everything i have learnt through buddhism we come face to face with our deepest fears when we are forced to live with a being as dangerous as the tiger with the soul in its eyes being only a reflection of our emotions or is it the tiger is merely a manifestation or projection of what is within ourselves this same tiger could symbolize a person situation or thing the tiger is our teacher however and we should thank it for teaching us greater understanding and compassion once we can open up and accept it for what it truly is and its nature hence also accept that part inherent in ourselves which we fear and fight the tiger keeps us alert tending to its needs gives us purpose and ultimately keeps us alive within a seemingly helpless situation we are all teachers in even just what we do silently and the boy is as much a teacher to the tiger as the tiger is to him actions transcends language as evident in the relationship between man and animal being forced to live together on a lifeboat and a makeshift floating platform at sea taught them both the greatest virtue of patience the roles of the predator prey or hunter hunted becomes reversed at some point in the story compassion prevailed instead we can also learn to appreciate the impermanence and transience of life in that this too will pass which is a proverb indicating that all material conditions positive or negative are temporary in the greater scheme of things perhaps when we finally reach shore to safety the tiger would walk right out of our lives and leave us unceremoniously once and for all without even looking back hence help us acknowledge the truth of what is happened that a final separation from that person has occurred and in that acceptance we come to peace the departure of the tiger could also just signify the change of quality within a relationship in the same way life does not go according to plan anyways and we could lose our loved ones suddenly in an unexpected turn of events in a shipwreck we will all grow old and die someday our whole lives is a grand orchestration of letting go but we are not the same boy as we were when we unwittingly started out on the greatest journey of our lives that would change our lives forever does god exist who knows for sure perhaps our individual journey is to discover the mind with the realization of the ultimate reality or enlightenment being the closest quality of experience in proximity hence intimacy to a god we could experience as stated in the hindu scriptures now i can honestly say that i can appreciate all the above mentioned in the movie life of pi ,7
en,-738069291,this movie may not match the popularity of the little mermaid here in the philippines but this one is animation at its very best the movements are so close to being human that you may sometimes forget that these characters were drawn this is evident in the dance hall sequence where the beast dances with belle the wonderful musical score is a no brainer for disney movies but who could ever forget the theme song to stay true to the original material is really hard to do but this one pulled it off with great success what also makes this film different is that it pulled in more adult audiences than kid audiences here in the philippines certainly there are singing spoons and plates but taking into consideration the spell that the whole castle went into adult audiences did not have a hard time taking it hook line and sinker the thing here is not to enjoy but to experience agree be my guest ,10
en,916763864,only reason i am adding my two cents in is because i want to negate one negative rating on this site i have not laughed this much since blazing saddles and people that is a long time ago i thought the hangover was brilliant my ## year old son begged me to take him that much i fear i should have did a little investigation a couple of scenes warrant nc ## i figured okay another pineapple express for my son what is ## minutes of boredom no biggie i went in blindly then wam this was f u n n y funny stuff if you did not laugh that sad maybe time to lighten up for me these were original and fresh gags and i am no fan of r rated sexist slap stick usually filled with mindless moronic nonsense but this movie is the bomb it is definitely a man movie though the writers are fantastic comedians with the utmost timing the acting is superb who are these dudes the only actor i recognized was heather graham and she was awesome too # thumbs up i am buying the dvd for sure no exaggeration for me this was the comedy of the decade ,10

en,-1145258790,when this movie first came out in #### i found this movie to be absolutely astounding but alas time marches on and thirty years later this movie is a dated relic of a bygone era the new york city of #### is not the new york city of #### indeed the same can be said for all of society but that not the movie fault rather in the ensuing thirty years since this movie was first released so much has happened and so many technological and demographic changes have occurred that the movie is now pass what was considered shocking then is now almost commonplace in movies today for instance the idea of a ## year old girl being a prostitute certainly raised lots of eyebrows in #### but today would gain scant notice even the main character travis bickle being a vietnam war veteran today would mean little if anything indeed would a guy like travis bickle even be driving a taxi in new york city today could he even afford to live in new york and would a guy like sport be a pimp not likely nevertheless this movie still provides a credible story about the effects of social isolation in an impersonal hostile violent alienating and degenerate urban environment which is the one thing that has not changed except for the worse and for this reason is still worth watching ,8
en,-1145258790,oh man this was a wonderful movie i have seen it six times robert de nero is great in this movie i wish we could see him do more of this kind of stuff although his recent comedies are pretty funny too jodie foster is one of my favorite actresses and this is the movie that kicked it all off harvey keitel as always is very good and it was great to see albert brooks in the movie the director martin scorsese rocks paul schraeder screenplay is tight and brutally honest i really like the score too the new york street scenes were all very real and gritty i do not know why they haven t decided to do a sequel i think it would attract a large audience because of the enormous following that the movie has already this is on heck of a movie ,8
en,-1145258790,in a calculated exercise i watched raging bull and taxi driver back to back today two classics and two films generally recognized by critics and fans to be among the best of all time personally i think bull was the better showcase for both de niro and director scorsese as the four years between films allowed both to improve on their respective crafts in terms of favorites that might be a moot point as both are darkly disturbing and violent films with main characters that are not particularly honorable much less likable indeed both characters the fictional travis bickle and the real life jake la motta were haunted by personal demons that manifested as forms of mental illness la motta brand of violence was legal inside the ring what he carried into his personal life resulted in a lifetime of unintended consequences the outcomes of fictional characters can be manipulated to suit the priority of the writer or director so in the case of taxi driver the protagonist winds up as sort of a hero at least to the parents of twelve year old hooker iris i am not sure if the point of the film had anything to do with showing how one life can turn on a second notice or not however when bickle assassination attempt on palantine leonard harris was foiled the succeeding events could have led to his own demise instead he reborn sort of one could sequel the story after betsy cybil shepherd gets a cab ride from travis at the end of the picture but it probably better left to the viewer imagination a tiny detail caught my eye in both pictures today which i am sure i would never have considered had i seen them days or weeks apart in the carnage of the shootout scene when the cops make their presence in the doorway of the rented room bickle puts a bloody finger to his head simulating a gunshot and two drops of blood drip from his finger scorsese used the same device again in raging bull when jake la motta is badly bloodied in his final fight against sugar ray robinson as the boxer sags against the ring ropes the camera focuses on the top rope a few inches away from la motta outstretched arm two drops of blood fall from the rope to the canvas to further intensify la motta defeat at the time i could not say why i found that to be so fascinating but now i do ,9
en,-1145258790,i am a bit late it took many years until i finally got around to seeing this film i already knew it was a classic and folks i knew told me how brilliant it was i had wanted to see it for along time but when preparing to watch it i still tried to keep my expectations on an moderate level fearing that it would feel overrated or old after seeing it i was just like why did i worry taxi driver is perfect first the film has aged extremely well sure you can see it been several years but thats not a disadvantage quite the opposite actually the look is just perfect to get the right feel of when it is set the style of the scenes are brilliant and the way the filming is done is just as brilliant soundtrack well chosen to set the feel some may think it a slow movie but it is not the pace at which the story is told is perfectly chosen travis bickle must be one of the most gripping characters ever even though the film is under #h one gets so close to him i really feel the loneliness that drives him to desperation is robert de niro portrayal one of the best performances ever i would say yes you talking to me the other actors are also brilliant jodie foster is incredible amazing supporting performances make every character just as important as the story does the character development is the central thing driving this film do not mistake this for an action film because it not a very disturbing film but the reasons lie much deeper than visual brutality the story slowly builds up to something which one might have an idea of what is still i sit at total attention to see what will happen next the ending shootout must be one of the strongest endings i have ever seen sad but still hopeful short but in a intense way the way the camera zooms over the scene when the fight is over genius the speech from the thank you letter very emotionally sad the ending is kind of open to analysis works great sometimes i can find it frustrating with open endings not here i immediately thought out what i think happened someone said it the kind of movie you watch once good but not to see many times i do absolutely not agree right after the ending i wanted to see it again and again taxi driver is strong disturbing thought provoking sad interesting and important it is all here martin scorsese definitive masterpiece and robert de niro best performance taxi driver holds up still today just as incredible as it has always been one of the greatest ever ## ##,9
en,-1286367522,what a way to start a day i saw this in a typically sun shiny morning and i can tell you if you are up for a depressing yet wonderful film to jumpstart your day i suggest road to perdition the film is about a mob gangster michael sullivan who was betrayed by his boss because his son michael jr inadvertently witnesses a murder so to tie all loose ends mob boss john rooney decides to kill his loyal right hand man but when connor rooney john rooney son mercilessly kills his family only his older son michael jr surviving he decides to go on a vendetta to avenge his family death the story is not your typical gangster film there no police cops to arrest mob bosses here nor drug cartels for that matter the story is focused on michael sullivan revenge on the people who betrayed him sam mendes and the writers managed to excellently blend a father and child story angle in a gangster themed story the performances were great tom hanks as usual delivers jude law unexpectedly sent chills down to my ancestors as a creepy looking psychopath photographer paul newman as the aging mob boss was great as well one minute you hate him for betraying his loyal right hand man the next minute you do not want him to die soaking wet daniel craig before james bond portrayed an annoying scheming mischievous son to a mob boss he had it coming to him yes he was spot on with his performance too the best scene in the entire film would probably be when michael sullivan ambushed john rooney and his mob thugs drenched in rain sam mendes did this slow mo shot when michael was shooting them with a machine gun in a distant house and the thugs were like dropping like flies and john was by the car with his head down realizing his grim fate michael killed all of them except john so he approached him with gun in his hand john turns to him almost into tears and utters what probably is the best line of the film i am glad its you michael with a sad look then shoots him down that scene will stay in my head forever it was emotional sad depressing and it almost wanna make you cry but somehow you feel that the michael character is doing the right thing very poetic scene to be remembered for ages ,10
en,-1286367522,this film really catches the viewer and takes it on a trip back in time into an atmosphere that is quite chilling and very interesting tom hanks is really cast in a new light with his role as a father who does unorthodox work and with a personality which at first seems quite cold and distant he plays so great i have to say that this film have given me a whole new view of him as an actor his son is also played very well and the whole cast is great i love everything about this film it is definitely worth watching for the atmosphere tension father son relationship great dramatic scenes brilliant actors and most importantly every single character has a depth that is unique in a film this short two hours you really get each and every character so high on detail that it is a great experience to watch ,10
en,-1286367522, road to perdition was a beautifully shot wonderfully lit piece of garbage the story was completely predictable full of father son relationship cliche there was absolutely nothing compelling about the characters tom hanks as the cold blooded killer with a heart of gold is so distant that we never feel the slightest bit of empathy for him or his endangered son paul newman in the role of tom hanks mentor just comes off as an old fool with an excess of misplaced loyalty jude law jude law was wasted a role with more meat on its bones would have been more worth his time and ours for a truly magnificent gangster film watch miller crossing instead the director of that film makes you care for the anti hero without resorting to hackneyed tricks like showing what a great dad he is ,7
en,-1684547873,we all once in a lifetime had this though of being someone else being john malkovich is an elaboration of our thought with a conclusion the movie must be appreciated for its weird characters performed really well by the actors from the very start the clues are given for the upcoming things in the movie but the writer just plays with our psychology script has some really riveting twists like that one scene when john malkovich enters his own mind humor is dark and meaningful director has focused on small details when lotte goes towards maxine to kill her and her head hurts the door ceiling i found no loose strings in the movie its designed in a way to hold you on your seat from the very start to the end the movie carries a dark feel to it very artistic and everything is placed perfectly to grab your attention really appreciable work by the whole crew ,8
en,1165106914,i never saw the this film when it was released many years ago but decided to watch it since this was the version that had never been seen before i remember many years ago of my friends telling me how scary this film was a girl that can turn her head around and vomit green stuff by today standards this film was not as scary but the girl running down the stairs backwards on all fours like a beetle was interesting however father karros was a rather pathetic character it is hard to believe that the demon would choose to take his body over the girls there was an opening story involving father merrin the real exorcist in the desert but i cannot figure out what was the point except to introduce a statue of the demon overall it was a fair movie but certainly not a classic demon picture ,5
en,-200415517,no words can do it justice so i wo not say a lot about it i never watched it in the theaters back in #### because i was not born until six years later i did not grow with all the star wars craze as many star wars fans did i knew the movies existed but i did not take much notice of them but all that changed one day i noticed that star wars was on tv so i sat down and watched it all though this was on television it was one of the biggest movie experiences i ever had the movie is pure perfection with a great story incredible effects at least for that time and some of the best music ever written for a movie but what really got me impressed was the incredible attention to detail lucas had every little being alien starship you name it has some kind of history i later watched the two other movies and got even more impressed when i saw the whole story unfold now i cannot wait for the prequels although episode i was a little disappointing too see the entire story quite simply the best movie ever made i rate star wars ## out of ##,10
en,-1634030876,simply put to kill a mockingbird is one of the best racial and discriminatory based movies in the industry i am amazed how the movie forced me to empathize with black people who were being discriminated against there were multiple times during the movie that i felt a deep sorrow and anguish towards an individual one of my favorite scenes and arguably the most compelling scene of the movie took place when atticus finch was exiting the courtroom when court was adjourned out of respect all the black people remained in the courtroom and stood up as atticus finch exited the courtroom the appreciation and gratitude that was demonstrated by the black people towards a white man that fought for them was stunning and packed full of emotions to kill a mockingbird was produced in #### by alan j pakula the director robert mulligan faced an overwhelming task of transforming the famous novel into a film the film success was due in large part of the spectacular job that pakula and mulligan did with developing the roles played by the characters there were three children that played major roles in this film jem was played by philip alford mary badham as scout and john megna played the role of dill i learned that all three of these youngsters had minimal experience in the acting business i would have never known this to be true the director did an amazing job of filming the scenes with the children it was as if the director allowed them to be natural opposed to acting from a script one of the main characters was atticus finch played by gregory peck atticus is an attorney in the film and represents the black man accused of raping a girl in the film atticus is a man of integrity and is highly respected in every aspect of his life he is highly regarded as a professional father figure and is well respected in the community another main character is played by brock peters he plays the role of tom robinson a black man who is falsely accused of raping a white girl tom faces the death penalty if he is found guilty of rape even if he is not found guilty i felt that he was going to be killed either way this message hit home with me i could relate to the power and hopelessness that prejudice can have on someone when atticus finch makes the decision to lawfully represent a minority in tom robinson i knew immediately the type of person atticus was a white man representing a black man in the deep south of alabama during the #### was unheard of it took someone with courage dignity and compassion to stand up and do the right thing atticus finch was the perfect man for the job there was not a better man that could have represented a minority during this time period the courtroom proceedings will have you sitting on the edge of your seat atticus finch does not disappoint as he uses a strategy to unveil tom robinson innocence the children make a surprise yet sneaky court appearance to watch atticus represent a minority the children sit in the balcony with all of the black folks this was a marvelous way that the director uses to demonstrate the children innocence towards racism the director main idea in doing this is to demonstrate that racism is a learned idea and attitude that is developed based on ones surroundings the way the movie is filmed allows an individual to feel as if they are in the movie themselves the acting presented in the film is very natural and is aided by the simple film angles that are used from the humanized characters to the simplistic film angles the director does a great job in making to kill a mockingbird a personable film this personal down home feel allows viewers to indulge themselves into the movie this indulgence makes it near impossible for the viewer not to relate and sympathize with the black community the one scene that demonstrates this best for me was the scene when the white man spits in atticus face for representing tom robinson i was so indulged in the film i literally felt that the white man spat in my face i felt the disgust and the hurt that atticus must have been feeling faced with a tremendous amount of disrespect atticus was true to his character and was the better man in turning and walking away even though atticus was a white man he could now directly relate to how the black community felt i cannot recommend to kill a mockingbird enough while children in their innocence may not be able to sympathize with the movie this is a great movie for young adults and adults alike the film represents humanity and equality at its greatest the character of atticus finch alone is an adequate reason to watch this film if you want to learn about true character dignity humbleness and respect just watch the character of atticus finch and be prepared to be blown away i have a feeling that this film will be a classic for many years to come and will remind americans of their past time and how far society has come ,9
en,-1634030876,the warmth and affection generated by kim stanley brilliant thoughtful narration in the oscar winning to kill a mockingbird could not capture better the essence of harper lee semi autobiographical novel i could swear hers is the inner voice i heard when i first read this book as a young teen a woman recaptures a single childhood summer during the great depression a period she recalls with great fondness despite the difficult times as seen through the eyes of an impressionable tomboy nicknamed scout the story set in a drowsy dusty alabama community initially centers comfortably around typical adolescent escapades until the town is jarred by a grown up incident in which an indigent black man is accused of raping a white woman scout widower father is given the daunting disputatious assignment of representing the already condemned man gregory peck as atticus finch is exemplary as the father we wished for as a child a tower of quiet strength he is a man of utmost integrity a steady voice of logic and reason a man of disciplined yet tender reserve a father you can count on to defend you against mad dogs or pervasive demons that disturb your sleep at night too perfect maybe but in that perfection atticus represents everything we aspire not only in ourselves but for mankind as well he is a reassuring factor that man in spite of his flaws is innately good and decent his saintliness accentuated by his offspring loving reflection peck utter sincerity in this role is never doubtful for a minute and for once his sometimes stiff sobering demeanor meshes beautifully with a character that has become his signature piece the superbly talented young uns mary badham and philip alford play the children scout and jem they may not have had longevity in their acting careers but here they make an everlasting imprint with performances so natural triggering sweet memories of our own lost innocence their simple joys and fears are exquisitely realized and instantly become our own they and the late john megna as their rather frail awkward summer time friend touch the heart with their simple discoveries theories and revelations the trial aspects may seem overblown by today standard but the dramatic tension and poignancy is not lost brock peters gives a deeply felt performance as defendant tom robinson a man rife with fear yet able to muster shaky courage and dignity throughout his ordeal on the other side of the coin james anderson gives despicable meaning to the term poor white trash as the bigoted redneck father of a piteous rape victim played with neurotic intensity by collin wilcox atticus closing argument and the trial denouement are only two of many highlights with peck speech one of cinema most memorable soliloquies slow minded recluse arthur radley who is taunted by the nickname boo a compelling robert duvall serves to represent the fear in all of us fear of the unknown he becomes a phantom like symbol for those who have ever been unfairly judged or persecuted due to prejudice gossip opinion and or ignorance his final scene with scout remains etched in my mind director robert mulligan evokes welcoming sentiment without the saccharine in this sensitive horton foote adaptation to kill a mockingbird never fails to open my heart mind and tear ducts a triumph of the human spirit it is a treasure to be sure ,10
en,616860393,this film was far from amazing d d lewis was very good and leo de caprio was ok but that where the praise stops diaz was terrible her character had no layers and was deviod of any emotion the scripting was inconsistent and the direction was sluggish and jaded there was hardly any plot and the one that was there was full of holes the humor some people pointed out distracted from the film rather than added to it it was needless for a film of this nature gangs of new york is meant to be about rivalry revenge and drama and although there were a couple of places where the dark humor really worked there were too many instances where the humor felt like tacted on hollywood cheese if you want to get some cheep thrills by seeing a bit of violence and mild nudity then this is the film for you if you are looking for a cinematic experience do not bother it would be a waste of a # hours of your life ,1

en,2015547123,if you enjoyed lock stock etc you will definitely enjoy this follow up film from guy ritchie in the same genre with once again an intertwining of east end shady characters after the same goal plenty of blood and guts shootouts and of course humour to me compared to lock stock the story line and connection of the characters was a bit clearer to follow and it was pleasing to see vinnie jones have more dialogue as well the funniest scenes were the three black guys in the car and also the attempt at robbing the bookies especially when trying to escape through the door i was impressed with brad pitt character and the fact that he was prepared to make the movie for a huge cut in fees and i also notice his name was not top of the bill if nothing else it is refreshing to see a big star be prepared to do a movie because they want to the type of movie only the brits can do and do not they do it well ,9

en,1555775733,despite previous efforts in the wolf of wall street what is eating gilbert grape the departed and titanic just to name a few leonardo dicaprio is still awaiting his first academy award but after watching the revenant you will realise that the wait is finally over after getting mauled by a bear and eventually rising from the dead poor leo embarks on a conquest across the freezing landscape in a story governed by the idea of revenge the film also explores rather cleverly many different themes including the wind the trees and their deep roots asides the brilliant acting performances of leonardo dicaprio and also tom hardy who definitely deserves his nomination for best supporting actor the visuals in this film are top class with the snowy mountains providing a fierce backdrop for the film itself however i do not believe this film is as good as the acting the story itself and the dialogue of which there is very little was not oscar worthy the cinematography on the other hand is as good as it gets with the bear attack being as real and unbearable as possibly imaginable the struggles of life for hugh glass leo are very well portrayed as his survival skills are put to the absolute limit overall a decent good film with lots of realistic violence and two superb acting performances however if you came to the cinema to escape the january cold you would be very very wrong # # ##,7
en,1268995831,ron howard a beautiful mind has been popularly considered a masterpiece certainly the film is very well acted russel crowe delivers a remarkable performance as the highly gifted mathematician john nash verging on madness jennifer connelly gives a capable performance as nash wife alicia ed harris christopher plummer and others also put in good performances the movie is also technically impressive and the musical soundtrack is wonderful except for that charlotte church song at the end but a beautiful mind is only a superficial masterpiece because it never achieves greatness i have not reached this conclusion lightly i gave this film considerable thought because although i instinctively thought that something big was missing i was not sure what that something was then it struck me the problem with a beautiful mind is really its tendency to oversimplify its subject matter great films force people to think and usually require more than one viewing to be understood but director ron howard fault is in making films like a beautiful mind that explain everything to the audience in very simple terms howard does not seem to understand that the people who go to see films like a beautiful mind do not like an oversimplified story because simplicity is boring in making this criticism i am referring to scenes like the one where john nash brilliant mathematical insight was explained in a very basic analogy of several men completing for one blonde woman in a bar these men decide to change their strategy by working together toward a lesser goal going after the brunettes so that they all get laid as i saw this scene i realized that ron howard cares far more about towing the line of the hollywood establishment than with the art of filmmaking hollywood unspoken assumption has been for the last ## years to oversimplify every story in order to make a film understandable even to unintelligent viewers and in the process get more people to buy theatre tickets when set against this deplorable standard a beautiful mind delivers the only trick that a beautiful mind has up its sleeve is that the world that the john nash character imagines is actually real but once that trick is exposed the plot is completely bereft of original ideas thereafter the story line goes through all the motions of resolving the conflict and arriving at a happy ending and the experience of watching this film becomes boring and predictable even the ending which is as artificial as the one in #### can be anticipated by the middle of this film a beautiful mind is not a bad film it can be quite interesting at times but there is something lacking and artificial about this movie because it is all based on a trick on the mind that we are in the beginning not sure about whether john nash weltanschauung is real or not after we discover the trick the only thing that we have left to do is wait for the movie to end russell crowe performance is worthy of an oscar and yet by the same token the john nash character is let down by the screenplay and direction there is no attempt made to explain the complexities of the john nash character we are simply told that he has gone mad and to accept that considering all the great films that have gone much further in adding depth and fascination to their characters the john nash of this picture he is much more interesting in real life is a bit of a let down there is also little effort made in explaining the wonders of mathematics even though john nash appreciated the potential of his craft well enough to come up with some very unique ideas instead math and madness are reduced to mcguffins for a simple love story between john and alicia that never was the real alicia nash divorced her husband during his prolonged spell with madness # # ##,7
en,1268995831,as a critic and student of film myself my first look at the poster for this film brought mixed emotions directed by ron howard yes written by akiva goldsman oh no a simple glance at mr goldsman filmography gives a very nice look at a list of movies that range from the non threateningly mediocre a time to kill to the atrociously horrible batman and robin lost in space i looked forward to this film with the sort of morbid curiosity one usually reserves for a pet with a terminal illness the film is not at all horrible on the contrary about ## ## of it is quite good ron howard remains one of the most talented directors of our time and russell crowe gives an outstanding nuanced performance also there are charismatic and enjoyable performances from supporting players jennifer connelly ed harris and paul bettany despite the best efforts of the supporting players however none of them really have much to work with ed harris almost does but by the time goldsman yanks the rug out from under nash and the viewer halfway through the film i developed an animosity toward a beautiful mind that i never recovered from howard does wonderful visual work as does cinematographer and coen brothers staple roger deakins relating the unique ulrta logical way nash mind works is no easy task and howard rises to it the mediocre writing however does nothing more than tell a good story badly and i do not think howard visual flare ever makes up for it i am all good and happy that goldsman saw fight club but he not nearly as talented as anyone involved with that film will ever be note to the viewer when christopher plummer shows up do yourself a favor get up leave take a bathroom break or fast forward about ## minutes into the future this bungled plot device fails but the rest of the film is really about an a minus ultimately flawed but a nice homage to the real john nash if those who knew him liked the film then what else is there to say ,7
en,-1981908864,this is hands down one of the best movies i have watched in recent time the storyline is captivating the suspense is gripping that not being enough the movie is topped by superb camera work innovative effects and a brilliant soundtrack however this comes at a price due to the choreography this film is anything but easy to watch some of the sequences halfway through the movie will make your head spin yet the whole effect o rama is never getting out of hand mild spoiler ahead if you complain about the violence try to think of what you would do if one of your loved ones had to end up like the kid in the movie you want to see an extraordinary action thriller grab this one i will definitely buy it on dvd ,9
en,-2744062,i was intitially a little apprehensive at viewing this film the reason being that i had previously viewed a quentin tarantino film from dusk till dawn and was very disappointed however this film was very good the writing was almost perfect tarantino deservedly received an oscar for his screenplay his direction was also very good and aided in the story line however i think the greatest asset to this film was samuel l jackson performance as a religious gangster not only does he perfectly portray the stereotypical angry black gangster but he infuses dark comic undertones unseemlingly john travolta also gives a great performance as jackson moronic sidekick with other good performances by uma thurman bruce willis and ving rhames this movie is definately a must see ,8
en,-2744062,and i could not be happier i love this movie who cares if it violent worlds full of enough politically correct wimps already for anyone who needs a laugh and is not offended by extreme vulgarity knock yourself out quick note to frank fans you probably are going to want to stay clear of this you will thank me later ,9
en,-2744062,from the very beginning you are drawn into the movie with samuel l jackson and john travolta who by the way have wonderful chemistry on screen debating whether a foot massage is considered cheating an all star cast consisting of the aforementioned jackson and travolta uma thurman bruce willis ving rhames really give this movie a dimension unknown to film making today quentin tarantino style of extraordinary dialogue and his ability to make even the most grotesque scenes comical is pure genius however the real beauty in this movie is the soundtrack unlike some of the more mainstream films today quentin is not concerned with bringing a certain demographic through the doors by choosing modern music that researchers believe will appeal to that demographic he actually chooses music appropriate to the movie quentin tarantino best movie to date ,10
en,-2744062,director quentin tarantino gives us a cinematic master piece with the film pulp fiction an anthology movie that is not told in chronological order which is what i think is a great idea to keep the audience on their toes to see what happens next the first story titled vincent vega and marcellus wallaces wife follows vincent vega played by john travolta who is told by marcellus wallus played by ving rhames to take care of his wife mia wallace played by uma thurman they go to a ## style restaurant titled jack rabbiit slims where the famous twist contest happens the story really escalates when mia has a heroin overdose and has to have an adrenaline shot fun fact the scene with vincent sticking the needle in mia was done by having john travota taking the needle out and running the film backwards because if he had actually jabbed it in he would have broken uma thurmans ribs the second story titled the gold watch is about famous boxer butch coolidge played by bruce willis who is supposed to throw a boxing match but does not and ends up killing his opponent he and his girlfriend fabienne played by maria de medeiors who are on the run by marcellus wallace they eventually get kidnapped and get sexually assaulted by # psychos zed played by peter greene and maynard played by duane whitaker butch ends up stealing zeds chopper saying the famous line zeds dead baby zeds dead the third and final story titled the bonnie situation is about vincent vega and jules winnfield played by samuel l jackson who end up killing their friend named marvin played by phil lamarr and end up going to their friend jimmies house played by quenton tarantino and get help from winston wolf played by harvey keitel to clean up the mess before bonnie played by pam grier they end up going to a diner which is being robbed by pumpkin played by tim roth and honey bunny played by amanda plummer this is my favorite of the # stories filled with crafty dialouge excellent story telling and great cast of characters this will always remain one of my all time favorite films i definitely recommend this work of art rated r for strong graphic violence and drug use pervasive strong language and some sexuality #hrs ##min ###min ### uses of the f word ,10
en,-2744062,tarantino first huge film is pulp fiction a profane multi layered character driven explosion of philosophizing hit men drug overdoses and leather bound gimps despite its long running time this mash of story and action is nearly nil of bore and continually entertains with every viewing sam jackson arguably has never been better travolta ditto uma is good as always rhames nearly mythical stoltz manages to make a drug dealer look like kind amanda plummer is crazy keitel calmly imposing alexis arquette was still robert arquette bruce willis great as always when it came out in the theaters it was evident that tarantino had created something like nothing else and more than a decade later scores of awful filmmakers still try to emulate this film cool and fluid chaos it not my favorite tarantino flick but i wo not argue if someone states that it his best ,10

en,88588036, casino royale was an unexpected pleasure i was never interested in any james bond movies but was very impressed with daniel craig as the new bond besides sean connery in his day daniel craig was superb with his rugged good looks and that unflinching stare the movie did not rely on gadgets nor special effects but rather acting and none stop action the running sequence reminded me very much of robert patrick in the terminator pumping both arms and legs i felt caught up in the chase i also appreciated bond sensitive side with his female co stars other bonds used women without a second look yet today bond left the hotel room after ordering champagne and caviar to do his job and comforted eva green after the shootout and fight scene during the poker game break i did want him to save eva green after that dramatic sequence in the water after the building collapse i was only disappointed when his efforts at cpr failed i thought he should have known to turn her on her stomach and massage her lungs to get the water out then tried cpr after all he is bond but again we cannot have a hero saddled down with a spouse so early in his bond film career i additionally enjoyed m being portrayed by a woman hats off to you i am looking forward to the next ### movie ,10

en,1439058182,with a great director such as steven spielberg who has directed some of my favourite films and great actors such as tom hanks and leonardo dicaprio i expected this to be a good film but after watching it i discovered it was greater than my expectation this film was not only well directed but contained great acting and a super complex plot which steven spielberg managed to pull off perfectly this film has a great rating and it fully deserves it i found that as it was based on a true story it really gets you indulged and makes you think thoroughly the fact that they put a nice little twist on the film made it that much better the fact that a ## year old managed to pull all this off and managed to become so successful and rich really makes you interested although it was not very dramatic and for a film of its time the special effects were not great overall i would defiantly recommend this film ### ,9

en,-813589240,spoilers one of the largest problems in the modern world is this on going issue of race whilst an improvement on the ####s there is little point denying that racism still exists in the world stereotypes are as powerful today as ever and people live in fear or hatred of another due to the colour of their skin in paul haggis crash this divide is brought to our screens and shows us a few home truths made with an excellent cast and with a wonderful script the film reminds us that in the majority of life decisions racism is there whether intentional or subconscious so much of what we do is driven by a dislike for someone of a different skin this is the disturbing truth of this film and when you have finished feeling unclean and guilty you realise that despite it message the film is a beautiful piece of cinema over the period of one day the lives of a number of los angeles inhabitants are intertwined the racist cop matt dillon the robbed district attourney brendan fraser the detective with family issues don cheadle and many others all these individuals find their lives coming together in one big racist mess beautifully shot crash is an amazing piece of work well written and directed by paul haggis it absorbs from the opening moments and leaves you thinking about it message long after it closing credits the cast also do an exquisite job matt dillon as the racist cop who seems to almost have racism built into his nature without any real reasoning don cheadle as the detective who has to look after his mum all are brilliant the award for finest performance though has to go to sandra bullock magnificent turn as the rich recently robbed wife of the district attorney played as a bitch with no real friends who fears rather than hates particular groups she assumes a constant misconception that all black and mexican americans are out to rob people one point also worthy of mention is the magnificent conversation between the characters of anthony and peter ludacris and larenz tate analysing life in a conversation reminiscent of tarantino the two discuss the evolution and position of the black man in society beautifully shot this scene then springs as ironic when the two conform to the stereotypes by robbing brendan fraser and sandra bullock the problem with crash if you can call it a problem is simply that it forces us to look inside ourselves and examine our own takes on racism it a topic which needs self examination but more often than not people wo not like what they see ultimately though as a piece of cinema crash is brilliant superbly written shot and acted it is a joy to watch a strain but a joy none the less for home truths you need to watch this film ,9
en,-813589240,in hollywood they should just look outside their walls and gates for a good story they do not have to travel very far the story of crash is complicated to describe but it is an ensemble piece with an excellent cast like matt dillon who plays the racist cop with sick father at home fighting with an african american hmo representative for coverage he takes his anger out on a successful african american couple thandie newton is unrecognizable and believable as the light skinned wife of a successful television director who gets felt up by dillon character and humiliated but in the end there is something called redemption that these characters seek and need to prove that they are not the cruel heartless caricatures of society matt dillon character is a veteran los angeles police detective but a racist filled with anger and hatred i hope he is not overlooked for his performance in this film by the end of it i wanted more and i saw this film on an airplane screen but i was glued to every word and scene brendan fraser is miscast as the los angeles district attorney he is just too young i love william fichtner who has been around for years and finally getting noticed sandra bullock is wonderfully complicated as brendan wife they both survive a carjacking and are distrustful the persian man who loses his place of business because of a break in and vandalism is also heartbreaking but you end up liking him and feeling sorry for him in the end but who suddenly has hope for the future despite losing everything to hatred this film is a lot about hatred prejudice racism sexism and it is also about redemption of the characters don cheadle is also wonderful in his role i hope the oscars do not forget about them one bit it the film that is worth watching again and again you want more when it over and you wonder why hollywood does not make films about life in los angeles finally the oscars votes came in and crash won the controversy over the other film is ridiculous and the most absurd this film was not meant to win an oscar for best film it was the little film that could when haggis directed it he was not thinking about how many awards this would win for him but the message of optimism in a pessimistic society i am glad crash won over the other film roger ebert named this film of the year in his annual top ten the other film came in # in my opinion i think the academy was right in selecting this film yes this film has just as much controversy as the other film does i wo not name it because it not worth mentioning it was the upset of the night and i would have loved to have watched it on television but i fell asleep and woke up to the news ,10
en,-813589240,if you take a book of o henry stories and you start reading the first story then after the first page skip to the second story and keep doing that till the end of the book and then start over with the second pages until you are done with the book that what crash is except in crash the characters are all in more than one story and they are played by famous people too hey that tony danza oh and they are all different races too like black and white and persian not arab so this makes the film very important and ludicrous is in it so that a good thing ludicrous like most of the characters is prejudiced he prejudiced against white people and chinese and also against negroes too and he does not tip the other good thing about this movie is it has a message not a message like seventh heaven you can be the best preacher in the north american viewing area but if you are wife not happy nobody happy but a really important message which is bad people are not all bad and good people are not as good as you think this is a really good message and probably should have been the name of the movie instead of crash it called crash by the way because people in the movie get up in each other faces like they are crashing around in bumper cars can you picture sandra bullock in a little helmet with a chin strap driving around in a bumper car and rear ending thandie newton who also has on a little helmet that would be entertaining so to summarize # people in l a do not like each other because they are different races and there is too much traffic # you need to actually go see the movie so you know this for sure # after you see the movie and get the message you will be a better person and be happy it won the oscar instead of a silly movie like munich or good night and good luck ,7
en,-813589240,cheers for the fact that this movie openly addresses the truth of non admitted racism the embracing of stereotyping from all sides all races but sneers to the fact that the scenarios that are set up to do so are so unbelievable that it plays more like a twilight zone story predictable for me and positively the cause of a migraine i suffered gays lesbians are among the most mistreated minorities in america today and they were no where to be found in this crash of a movie every single other film up for an oscar was better than this piece of crap and yet the academy gave this movie best picture who says hollywood is liberal and not politically corrupt ,1
en,922129673,this is one of my top movies as it has great acting directing and it truly changes your life or at least how you view life the idea that things we own own us is well expressed however as some of you have commented it seems silly that brad pitt is remarking on how society expects all men to look fit handsome etc not only is he ripped but his hair is constantly styled in such a way that it is obvious that this character cares enough about appearances to put time into gelling his hair while i thought brad was perfect for this movie he also detracts from the validity of it one of my favorite scenes is at the end where the buildings fall to the pixies where is my mind ,8
en,922129673,fight club is just amazing you combind a good a controversial story with two of the most talented actors of today norton and pitt and with the excellent style of david fincher you have an brilliant film i like it because of the satire in the film jack norton just hates his life and he wants to change it it is full of black humor and sometimes it just weird but that good i do not think that there is to much violence because i think the violence is used functional everbody should see this movie because it is most definately the best satire ever made ,8
en,922129673,after watching this movie your taste buds are likely to change forever you will feel that all those run out of mill factory assembled excessively marketed movies from hollywood will no longer appeal to you if you are up for it welcome to fight club the first # rules of the fight club are that you do not talk about fight club so i do not want to ramble edward norton plays a cynical insomniac who is in search for a meaning of life and the proprietor of the fight club pitt provides exactly the same however norton ultimately realizes that he has probably got more than he bargained for so well you have to see for yourself ,9
en,922129673,from the first couple of seconds this film offers a vivid and stark contrast to most other high budget hollywood efforts now adays we are greeted by the narrator held captive by his alter ego tyler durden the colours scream at us the lighting freezes us and the dialogue more often than not in the face of disturbing imagery makes us want to laugh not so much at the plights of the characters on screen but at ourselves i saw this film recently on dvd and was blown away the acting was top notch showing pitt in a role that he actually decided to act in norton was as whole heartedly convincing in fight club as he was in american history x his performance often making me feel physically ill in response to the sheer confusion he faced the film carries with it a message as immense as the shock at the end the film directly attacks materialism and the ways in which we see the world in todays society that is so focused on social standing and material gain over happiness fincher directs the film like a music video however unlike many who have tried this approach it actually fits in perfectly with the films subject matter the stark over exaggerated contrasts betweem the outside world and the damp basement in which most of the violence in the film is based the world slowly during the course of the film comes to resemble that basement in more ways that are apparent through a single viewing this movie will take repeat viewings to appreciate fully but it is worth it the direction is fabulous the acting brilliant the story engaging and at times sickeningly close to home i give it a high # out of ## the only downer being that at times especially near the end the film takes a turn that will have most frustrated with the sheer unreality of it all this may be a turn off to some it was not to me but to others whose ability to suspend belief is sharper this film makes for amazing eye and mind candy watch it ,10
en,922129673,i was expecting to see a fairly serious dramatic movie but was pleasantly surprised by this twisted and some what weird movie that has the right touch of action humor and dramatic moments i actually enjoy the narrative i know some people are put off by actors narrating their thoughts out loud and prefer reading the actors expressions but i think a lot will be missed in this morning to try to figure out the weird thoughts people have in their mind this is a good movie hope to see more of it ,5
en,327575819,a western head of state breaks his own laws and sends an inadequately small but highly skilled army away from the homeland to battle middle eastern jerks and force a military stalemate but enough about current events if you were hoping for something a little more uplifting in ### the second cinematic adaptation of a frank miller graphic novel i am here to tell you it pretty much another deep sea dive into the black id of our basest instincts yay first some quick kudos to those in charge of the visuals in this film bravo truly watching this film was like seeing a frank frazetta painting come to life gorgeous action sequences luscious costuming and set design but in terms of plot the film tone is set early when a diplomat from the persian empire comes to visit the spartan king leonidas to suggest the spartans surrender or be invaded the diplomat a black guy with a lot of freakily jewelry and lip gloss not quite the olive skinned greeks one might imagine all the spartans in this movie look as though the cast of desperate housewives decided to have a toga party the cynical symbolism zooms off from there like some kind of nazi propaganda film based on true historical events king leonidas proceeds to mobilize the grecian world against xerxes i and the persian empire by bravely leading the small fighting force for which the film is named until they are ultimately overwhelmed by superior numbers we all certainly owe a debt of gratitude to the real leonidas for his part in repelling a culture that may have otherwise devoured the very basis for our democratic traditions bravo my brother but if it an accurate dramatization of these events in their true historical context you are looking for be prepared to be disappointed big time if you are in the market for a lot of dubious implied parallels between this ancient struggle and the current state of relations between the judeo christian west and the muslim middle east however you are in for a rare treat in the present version king leonidas responds to the persian diplomat by killing him and his entire entourage in cold blood it okay though because the diplomat as we mentioned was just some fruity black guy and the entourage were all dressed like modern day terrorists the parallels being implied stand out in stark relief when gerard butler leonidas waits for permission from his wife to murder the diplomat you could see even the hardest gulf war vet waiting for a nod from the wife to shoot a burglar but i bet the real king leonidas did not ask his woman if he could declare a war the willowy lena headley queen gorgo of course gives the nod and later cuckolds her husband to score him some political points she clearly a real lady as security mom simile she all but drives from one scene to another in an suv the comparison could not have been more complete if she were sitting in a spartan starbucks spouting self serving tales about the trials of being a full time queen while raising an eight year old prince we naturally never see the horde of slaves the real queen gorgo certainly had at her disposal night and day like some kinda neo con suck up wet dream the film proceeds to demonize nearly everyone who is not a statuesque white guy with really nice abs these white guys strut around in cod pieces and red capes with their pecks hanging out like some kind of chippendale chorus line with spears of course with rare exception they annihilate everyone in their path until they are betrayed by a hideously deformed warrior wanna be they would not let in their club poor poor us here a quick reality check first persia eventually became iran and in #### the cia helped engineer a coup in which a democratically elected prime minister was deposed and a monarch the shah of iran was installed as the head of state and this was all done to protect western oil interests never mind the crusades second western style democracy is on the march all over the face of the planet even communist china has embraced western style capitalism third no muslim state exists which could hope to match america military or economic might but gosh that no fun is it i mean without some big enemy juggernaut with which to spar we might actually have to sit down and think about what to do with the unprecedented peace and wealth all our forefathers from leonidas to bill clinton have bestowed upon us should we ensure health care for all end poverty in our lifetime address global warming explore the depths of the sea build high speed rail go back to the moon challenge ourselves to forever raise the bar for all our noblest aspirations naaaaaaaaaaaahhhh let demonize everyone who is not just like us and make them all look like a pack of corrupt deformed homosexual religious fanatics let lump them all in with the rag tag network of muslim malcontents that manages to slip a bomb by us every now and again yes i feel so much better now i no longer need to worry if my abs are the tightest or tannest i can just align myself with this cabal of hatred and everything else will just fall into place sig heil if you want to see a good historical drama about courage colliding with politics might i suggest erpico the hunt for red october or all the president men if you want to see a good movie about dutiful and honorable warriors realistically dispatching enemies i would recommend gladiator glory or aving private ryan as for ### the people who crafted this ugly little ball of snot masquerading as entertainment ought to be sent to walk foot patrols outside the green zone in iraq ,3
en,327575819,i personally find this a much more rewarding film than the other recent frank miller film sin city the characters in sin city were very cold which may have been deliberate but it left the viewer with the same detached cold feeling whereas sin city had a well known cast the cast for ### are less well known but for the large part they put in some good performances butler and west in particular put in good performances the story and film title focuses on the ### spartans as they fight against the overwhelming forces of the persians it seems to me like the spartans must have had some very impressive gym equipment judging by the definition of the soldiers with scantily clad women the eye candy factor of the film is high i suspect the film will mostly appeal to red blooded males who love plenty of fighting garnished with battle cries and nude women having said that women who like muscles will also have plenty to keep them occupied for the film connoisseur the photography is a pleasure although the script is a bit clunky in places better than expected ,5
en,-443051251,these were the good old times when hollywood really was great this movie shows what movie and television can look like when producers and writers approach the script with decency respect and creativity this is how you create round characters who entertain make you laugh make you cry feel with them make you think about the world make you feel touched make you feel good this was when entertainment from hollywood meant and represented something when movies were no vehicles for clumsy political propaganda to deflect from national political problems and slandering other nations and not even being historically correct while doing so if you want to get back to real decent greatness hollywood tv than you should work on perfectly written presented stuff like this movie heartfelt non offensive valuable characters treating each other with dignity or rather learning to do so in the end perfectly acted pure perfect instructive constructive entertainment no offenses sex or violence necessary this is the real thing this deserves awe this is what once made hollywood great and since then hollywood just got more and more destructive destroying their audiences around the world and destroying themselves its reputation good old times back then indeed and they will probably never return ,10
en,1854380845,i just have to tell you guys who are thinking of seeing this film see it i saw it a while ago at the movies i was practically crying afterwards a bum scared me on the street and i ran off unable to sleep the rest of the night alone in my shabby old room with fear the the saw man would be under my bed anyway why is this movie so good well i am often skeptic and scared of scary movies but i always get sick and tired of the stupid people in them as a change these movie characters has a brain finally have not seen anything scarier since the cube it unpredictable believe me i would have never guessed who did everything bloody disgusting and absolutely wonderful so for all you guys who hate scary movies see it with a male or female friend i found it scary closed my eyes screamed that what a scary movie should get out of you scare your f ckin pants off ,10
en,1854380845,overall i think this is a must own movie i understand why the powers that be classify it as a psychological thriller i ranked this at a # because there were some obvious plot holes however those holes were not so much that they detracted from the film being fascinating to watch in fact i really did not think of them until i was done watching which i think is one of the trademarks of a good film good points # fast paced the movie hit the ground running and never let up # intense same comment # makes you think my mind was racing after this film trying to wrap around everything that happened regarding plot holes to be fair i am also not in a life or death situation sitting on my sofa so it easier for me to think of these things # not too much gore there is a bit of blood but it was very tolerable # never guessed jigsaw at the end when jigsaw is revealed never saw it coming never ever # watch it multiple times speaks for itself bad points # a bit dramatic at times at times the acting by both leigh whannell and cary elwes was a bit much for the most part they did well with their roles but i have definitely seen cary elwes in better # plot holes again once the movie finishes and you start to think about the storyline etc there are some holes # unanswered questions there are some unanswered questions for me at the end i do not know if they had already planned to do aw ii when this was released but at the end of aw you are left with some but what happened questions incidentally if you feel the same way many of my questions were answered in aw ii that it for me happy viewing ,7
en,1854380845,well i viewed saw because i was looking for a random movie to watch surprisingly i do not actually recall too many scares in this film then again that also probably cause i have sorta gotten acquainted with the thriller horror etc genre now it a lot better than seven which was just ### disturbing and causing you to either puke or turn away before you are naturally inclined to the film as most have already said is one of those intellectual we drop ### hints which most of you wo not piece up till the end when we do it for you puzzles there are a few scenes and events which will make you think yea saw that one coming especially the final twist you cannot blame the film however it does a pretty good job overall and through some good effort manages to steer clear of ending up with too many i saw that one coming style bibs bobs worth a watch if you are into the genre ,7
en,-1621537004,it takes a heck of a strong screenplay and a great actor to hold a viewers interest in watching how a man struggles to maintain his sanity while being cast away alone on a small island for years i was moved by the story and hanks plays the part beautifully perhaps as well as or better than any other of his acting peers my only disappointment came with the very end ,9
en,-1621537004, cast away is about as far as any stereotyped stranded on an island movie or television series as you can get there is no survivor in this one nobody gets voted off the island there is no bumbling oaf keeping everyone from being rescued and the only minnow that shows up is one that tom hanks beautifully cast in this role eats alive when he first is trying to find a food source after being stranded this was a good movie to watch i paid # ## to see it and yes i feel my money was well spent hanks reportedly dropped ## pounds for this role and it is indeed noticable it not exactly the best family film to see but it not one you are going to waste your time on either the plot is not too contrived but there really is not much you can do while stranded on an island except get to know the island and wait to be rescued with that little premise to work with the cast and crew did their best and it shows with the elaborate scenery powerful acting by hanks and mind tingling special effects i would go see this movie again yes but probably only once more after all there only so many stranded on and island scenarios that you can run through before you start screaming for the skipper i kept waiting for an innuendo or at least a passing mention of gi and finally it came definitely a must see at least once then you can decide for yourself whether or not if you do would the same ,10
en,-1621537004,i was surprised to read after seeing cast away that it is almost three hours long i did not squirm as i usually do while watching a movie of that length so that speaks well for the movie however i did not think it was a super wonderful movie either roger ebert complains in his review that zemekis and company revealed too much of the plot in the trailer for cast away i concur with ebert although i may have come by my prior knowledge by reading reviews or talking to people who saw the movie the ending was a good idea with our protagonist meeting the woman who sent the fedex package at the beginning of the movie classic envelope pattern but it was not filmed well with hanks standing in the middle of a dusty texas intersection pondering which direction to take next i wish it had been more like the ending to heaven can wait when the man and the woman started talking and it was clear they were going to hook up i would have given cast away a rating of # but raised it to # because the movie did not seem as long as it was ,5
en,-1621537004,this movie would have been so much better with some scenes of what chuck friend and girlfriend were going through over the four years he was on the island like what their lives were like scenes of the events of her life no spoiler also once he gets rescued they clean him up too quick one minute he is on death door the next minute he is the aqua velva man i would have liked to see him in his just rescued robinson crusoe look trying to relate to humans again and contrast his wild man look interacting back with civilization ,7
en,-1959729897,this a marvelous action film as it combines some heavy duty action scenes with maximum realism except maybe for the old machine guns who never run out of ammo thing but i am so used to that i hardly react to it anymore and great work by both the director and camera people with some actual in depth views on the lives of both the good guys and the bad guys represented mostly by pacino and deniro respectively portraying them both as something in between good and bad yet making a clear distinction as to who we are supposed to be rooting for and yet we end up liking both characters and i found myself actually hoping that deniro should get away free and the end could really have been bad i mean the whole film is a buildup to the final confrontation but it was actually pretty ok sure they could have done it better but nine out of ten other directors writers would have done it worse there are of course a few things i really would have liked to see in this movie but as it was already pushing at three hours it understandable that it stops where it does even though it leaves more than one string of plot unfinished finally yes i cried at the end it was the music i am a sucker for moby ,10
en,631676366,meryl streep is sister aloysius and philip seymour hoffman is father ryan in this riveting drama from john patrick shanley drawing from his experience at a catholic school in the bronx of the ####s the adaptation from shanley play will bring back memories to anyone with similar childhoods i can recall the nuns at my school walking up and down the aisles commanding the full attention of the class streep nails it so convincingly that she appears to have taken vows before filming the part the same can be said of hoffmann who seems to have been ordained after seminary training doubt will leave you wondering about faith religion and what to believe in the plot revolves around a ## year old boy who may or may not have been molested by father ryan and the ensuing search for the truth by sister aloysius there is no sentimentality at any point shanley keeps it real to the end we will always in our lives have doubt ,8
en,1491951385,the bourne ultimatum brings jason bourne story to its inevitable conclusion and does so in the best way possible this time around paul greengrass and company outdo everything they did in the previous two entries matt damon and the rest of the cast give outstanding performances and the attention to story and character this time has been fine tuned to perfection in this third entry jason bourne finally comes home to take on the agency and find out once and for all who he is and how he got that way the cast has been expanded slightly yet again this time adding david straithairn as a ruthless cia chief who runs a black ops unit scott glenn and albert finney also have smaller roles as the cia director and the doctor who introduced bourne into the program respectively what ensues is a globe hopping adventure that gives the audience some amazing on location shooting and enthralling action set pieces my personal favorite and the centerpiece of the movie is an intense chase through the streets and back alleys of morocco culminating in one of if not the best hand to hand fights in the series and this time despite the chaotic nature of the cinematography all of it was immensely more comprehensible than in the last entry even the car chases i also thought that they did a better job this time of balancing the different story elements and cutting between a variety of locations in a way that always kept the story moving they also succeeded in bringing things full circle as well as teasing some new developments which could be used in future sequels and were in the bourne legacy while bringing closure to bourne story they did not end things such a final way which i thought was great after all of the great storytelling of these first three i am definitely in the mood for more of it overall i think that this is the pinnacle of the bourne series which was already very good to begin with it the american answer to bond as well as being an anti bond it keeps you immersed in a believable world with real characters and human drama as well as showcasing the best action that hollywood has to offer seeing the previous two is kind of a prerequisite for understanding this one but once you do you should not miss this one ,10
en,1491951385,i rarely give out a ## but the bourne ultimatum deserves it not just for the terrific ride that it takes us on but for giving us a great conclusion to what is in my humble opinion one of the best trilogies ever it does not feel contrived drawn out or in any way just cashing in on previous films as other series have greengrass carries on where he left off from supremacy complete with the hand held camera that places you in the heart of the action this seems to have divided opinion but for me it works brilliantly especially with the fight and car chase scenes much as i would love to see more bourne it hard to see where they would go with the character now especially as this film ties up all the loose ends from the previous two in a really satisfying way i know there have been sequels written to the ludlum books but to be fair the films bear little resemblance to the novels one thing for sure is that the bourne trilogy has reinvented the spy genre and it something that has not gone unnoticed by the james bond franchise with their recent reworking of casino royale definitely one to see more than once ,10
en,1491951385,for some this movie will be nearly unwatchable the plot seems to be really good the action is non stop and intense the pacing may be a little frantic and maybe just maybe there was some really good fight choreography but i could not tell through the disastrous camera work it as if someone not only shot everything hand held but added oscillating mass drivers turned up to ## it took so much away from the film i came away feeling ripped off yes i know that that is greengrass style but it was worse in this movie than his previous efforts and when combined with the other movie shooting clich s the blurry obscured over the shoulder talking head shot which is ok once or twice but beaten like a dead horse here ends up burying what felt like might have been a great movie in a total mess ,4
en,1491951385,wow i cannot believe how many people are rating this movie so highly especially when in my opinion it was probably the weakest of the three the only interesting parts were the scenes within the organization as the action scenes mostly had that been there done that feel although to be fair they were on par with what we expect from the series maybe i should explain that i was hoping for an espionage movie or at least something with more twists and turns the story did not captivate me that much the dialogue was mediocre and the character focus is a little underplayed this movie should have been full of dialogue and creative plot points rather the script felt extremely short and i kid you not when i say that the entire plot is revealed in the trailer in fact except for the ending pretty much the entire story is given to you in the trailer so unless you are starving for more escape action fight scenes that you have already seen in the first two movies my recommendation is to just re watch the first one watch the trailer for the third one and go on line and find out how it ends there nothing to gain from actually seeing it ,5
en,-85678817,one of the big movie events of the year clint eastwood changeling has had a lot of buzz going about it up to its release and i can tell you that all the chatter about this movie is well deserved based on a true story the movie focuses on single mother christine collins angelina jolie a working class woman living in #### los angeles with her son walter after returning home one afternoon to find walter has vanished she seeks help in the los angeles police department to help find her son around five months later a boy believed to be walter is brought to l a from illinois and reunited with christine the only problem is the child returned to her is not in fact walter what ensues is a bitter battle with the los angeles police department and the lead of the investigation j j jones jeffrey donovan aided by a reverend who knows of the lapd corrupt history john malkovich christine desperately searches for her son but ends up disbelieved by those around her meanwhile a deranged serial killer who may know something about walter disappearance is on the run plainly put i simply loved every piece of this movie everything about it was stunning from the music to the acting to the scenery it was all so amazing but besides the aesthetics of the film what is the true point of interest here is the central mystery of the film what happened to walter collins we the audience are taken on an emotional disturbing roller coaster ride as jolie does everything in her power to find her son but is stomped on repeatedly by those around her often males there are layers and layers to the story here but beneath the surface there is strong commentary on female submission during the era the power of males in society and the obvious corruption and greed that can be found within a system that is supposed to help the citizens all of this comes across quite well and the elements of the film coerce nicely angelina jolie delivers an outstanding performance here that i am sure would make the real christine collins very happy her emotions mannerisms everything is so spot on she owns the role and the audience can do nothing but sympathize with her character as the grieving yet strong willed mother supporting performances from academy award nominee john malkovich and somewhat overlooked performer jeffrey donovan who some horror fans might remember from the blair witch sequel are all deserved of praise as well another thing i would like to mention is the capturing of the time this is a period piece all around and a very refined one at that everything is precise and the costumes set design and styles of the ####s are extremely strong if not completely flawless the resolution to the events of the movie still leave questions but give enough information as to what happened to walter the unraveling of everything that takes place about three fifths through the movie is rapid and intense with the unveiling of a disturbed ranch handler who was responsible for the savage murders of twenty kids at his desolate farm one of them maybe or maybe not being walter apart from the missing child aspect of the film which makes it disturbing to begin with the introduction of the serial killer aspect is even more horrifying accompanied by some awfully disturbing flashback sequences depicting the crimes all the more horrible is that everything in the film is in fact true and did happen but at the end of the day the movie does leave its audience with a glimmer of hope and concludes itself on a somber but satisfying note as justice is served and some small sense of peace is delivered to ms collins overall changeling is an extraordinary movie going experience as far as period pieces go this is probably one of the very best i have ever seen and the multi layered plot never loses the viewer i was completely engaged through all two and a half hours the film lasted and was extremely happy with the movie when i left the theater beautiful cinematography and essentially flawless performances add to the positives here i really cannot complain about this movie at all changeling is a tragic and disturbing tale of murder corruption empowerment and above all justice that will haunt the audience for days after viewing highly recommended to anyone who likes a seriously good movie ## ## ,10
en,-85678817,angelina jolie is christine collins single mom who was a lead operator at the phone company back when a bunch of ladies put calls through at a switchboard she is so competent that her boss says she will be considered for a supervisory job even though it was still thought back in the ####s that most women could not handle such a job but one evening when she had plans to go to a movie with her son # she was called in to work she told her son not to leave the house gattlin griffith is her son walter collins when mom came home walter was not to be found in the house nor the neighborhood and no one had seen him she did the only thing she knew called the police and reported her son missing they investigated for months without turning up anything until one day christine gets a call that they had found her son in illinois her elation turned sour when she met the boy at the train station he was not her son even though the police told her kids can change in # months this one was # inches shorter and was circumcised later both her son teacher and her son dentist verified that the boy could not be walter but the los angeles police known for corruption were attempting to cover their incompetence by finding a son for christine and closing the case another key character is john malkovich as rev gustav a briegleb who made it his mission in life to work to expose the corruption in the police department he took an active part in christine fight and through his efforts including his radio broadcasts enlisted the public to help fight the cause the whole story is historically accurate and angelina jolie is superb as christine the movie is really her story more than anything else spoilers even though most already know the details walter was one of perhaps ## boys that were stolen off the streets of los angeles and taken to a ranch to be molested and killed although they never verified walter death he was never found either his mother never gave up hope of seeing him again the impersonator had used walter name to get to hollywood to meet tom mix the case was brought against the chief and certain other members of the police department and led to positive reforms ,7

en,-537615582,having just completed a back to back comparison of the two volumes of tarantino kill bill its clear that his two narrators have very different storytelling styles kill bill vol # was a tribute to the kung fu films of the ## and later as told by hattori hanzo sonny chiba blood honor and kung fu style fighting were paramount in vol # the bride uma thurman narrates our story in the style of a classic film there is more of a noir attitude and feel the violence is more realistic and frequently implied instead of seen onscreen a few graphic moments aside the story is told wonderfully in a more linear style incorporating more flashbacks than out of order chapters tarantino direction is crisp with impeccable acting by thurman daryl hannah finally gets her moments in the sun as our stunning villain while bill carradine may be the man behind the evil elle hannah is the true evil villain reveling in the destruction of her enemies all in all the two movies together tell a great story and the stylistic differences clearly delineate between the two films ,10
en,-537615582,sure the film is much slower and less relentlessly action packed than the first but you cannot compare the two because they were originally one movie thats why i am going to count them as one yes the film has it share of cliches but they seem intentional so i was not bothered in vol # it takes more time to build up the story that vol # did not completely cover it shows you the sides of every persons story and develops the characters it does not have the breath taking fighting scenes the first one has but as one movie it has the best story development and action i have seen in a while people who hate this movie are normally people who do not like the trailer and decide to not see the movie itself thats how i was before i finally saw vol # ,10
en,-537615582,for those of you that have already seen and enjoyed the first film this film may be a disapointment while the first film was full of frantic action and super human kung fu moves this film is definitely waay slower in execution first things first this film is far too long spoilers ahead i do not understand why the spanish pimp was in this film at all he seems to talk very slowly and neither his words nor his actions have any consequence on the film at all likewise the same with bill last scene he seems to talk at length about well not much at all really while one complaint of the first film was the lack of dialogue in volume # there is simply too much to handle long drawn out passages from bill try to illustrate the depth of his character but by the end of the feature its clear that he a pompous ass bud is a loser and we are not told why his scene in the bar was included as it has no bearing on any of the other characters the one saving grace is gordon liu character providing some comic relief his character pei mai is a ridiculous parody of nearly every master character that ever existed and liu seems to relish the role on balance i think volume # is a slightly better film than the first as tarantino does not seem intent on showing off his cool film collection every # seconds this was one thing that really riled me through vol # but the pacing is too slow the camerawork is great the fight scenes are superbly choreographed the sound track is cool and daryll hannah is brilliantly vampish but for reasons cited above this movie is less than brilliant ,10
en,-2144779484,everyone was wrong in this movie for their own causes but the most wrong was sheriff lester burdon first burdon was among the officials who inhumanly evicted kathy from her house then he was trying to help by keeping an interest of his own to mingle with kathy he also ruined his family life by abandoning his wife and # young kids then he was breaking the law again and again so he end up in prison kathy was wrong because if she had opened the notice of county for taxes this problem may not have surfaced up kathy brother was wrong because when she asked him directly for help he was too busy even to listen her properly county was wrong for giving unnecessary taxes to somebody who does not owe those business taxes and then evicting the woman from her house and selling it so soon just for ### behrani was wrong because he wanted to make a profit from an auctioned house for his own cause as he was a well positioned colonel in the past but in the present he was hard working in day labor jobs and in stores at night esmail the son of behrani was wrong for pulling the gun out of sheriff in the courtyard for which he has been shot by other officer ,9
en,-2144779484,great character study involving people from different cultures and class ben kingsley never stops amazing me with his acting and connelly was good also along with the rest of the mostly unknown cast maybe a little too dark for most people i tried to put myself in both positions kingsley saved up his money from numerous jobs to buy this once in a lifetime sale plus he goes from a decorated military officer in iran to doing mostly blue collar jobs in the bay area as for connelly position at times i felt bad for her situation who knows what her ex husband did maybe he did have control of the finances of the house and when he left she was up the creek but she still should of checked her mail from time to time i wonder what connelly family thinks after this she pretty much lied to them about her situation i am sure thats a movie in itself ,9
en,-2144779484,the film on the whole approaches utter hack work the direction vacillates between sloppy and grotesque heavy handedness it like being beaten about the head with a two by four not much in the way of subtlety kingsley good shohreh aghdashloo is splendid connelly adequate in an underwritten unsympathetic and utterly preposterous role the story basic concept is so weak to begin with it hard to suspend disbelief as much as we are asked to ,4
en,1037159720,this is an awesome movie the story line is tantalizing the acting is sweet the science is amazing and everything is just awesome with a few exception one notable for me is that it seems that he is eating something or drinking something the majority of times that we see him that tend to be a bit annoying its not like all you do on mars is eat drink and well eat more there was to much emphasis on food and eating and consumtion and to little on the fact he could have done some amazing discoveries on mars it was not like he spent every waking moment from the time of the accident to the rescue on thinking of ways to survive there was ample opportunity to do real science as well and there was a little to little emphasis on that ,9
en,1037159720,i am sure all who have read the book feel they fully missed it with this movie it simply is not possible to tell the story in # hours without cutting so much out that it cannot create the back stories emotions and the how and why best way to get this story is by audio book from audible and you after each hour will notice how making it a ## part netflix series would have worked so much better there are many natural cliffhangers emotional ups and downs and moments that would have you think how would you react as the main person the human population or the different people at nasa gpl i am sure many of the people involved in this movie also miss what they liked about the book and is totally missing from the movie because of the huge missing parts that result in things becoming random and happening for no clear reasons ,4
en,1037159720,i have not read the book nor was the movie made for those who did also i know that lots of things were changed or omitted altogether so i write this review with no relevance to the original source the movie consists of # part mars scenes and # parts people talking and looking at monitors but that okay the movie had only ###ish mil budget you got to feed the stars right the movie ends like a fairy tale with cheers hugs and applause have a nice dinner afterwards to complete the evening call your parents and invite them for christmas or something because the elation simply wo not last the movie has a very positive vibe to it you never feel that the main character is in any real danger even when he humbly declares that he broke his ribs the acting is rehashed from other movies and is not convincing i assume it is how they got their roles in the first place with damon and chastain coming straight from the interstellar set with not much else changed aside from scenery and the plot i think i got used to damon fake tears by now he does it good so good that you realize he does it exactly the same every time cue in the visual explanation clich of a complex plot device complex for you of course yes similar to the one in the interstellar overall a very smooth formulaic and sterile space drama with very little memorable scenes at least not an hour later no sean bean was harmed in this movie they even let him to play golf in the end # ##,7
en,-1049821396,i found the butterfly effect storyline gripping and interesting but if i had not been at a friend place at the time i would not have watched more than five minutes because all the violence language sexual content just put me right off i only stayed int eh room cause i did not want to look stupid pretty dumb of me cause the bad outweighs the good by far here movies like this could be sodramatically improved if they found other words to replace f removed the sex scenes they are not relevant ever and did not get so in depth with the violence there are better more imaginative ways to get a point across even so i have to admit that the plot was very intelligent really reels you in when you think time travel films you expect some fantasy star trek but this film is nothing like that it basically about someone with an awful life who tries to change his past when he discovers he can time travel back and alter things every time he changes something though something else go wrong hence the butterfly effect or chaos theory in case you do not know the butterfly effect is the theory that a butterfly can flap it wings somewhere and the tiny gust of wind it makes can cause a tidal wave halfway around the world the story is riveting like all the ordeals he go through as things get worse and worse and the story slipping back and forth in time and of course there kutcher in it and that a bonus still the only people who would watch this are people who like gloom and death and violence these things can all be made exciting in a holly wood film with all the cinematics and twists and turns but who really wants to see something so miserable and pretty much void of any closure at the end that abortion thing was terrible completely spoiled by a huge overdose of profanity violence and sexual content not worth the rental fee ,8

en,-1220203213,what started out as an interesting movie idea to me became a struggle to watch until its completion kate winslet plays kind of a freaky girl quite a departure from what you are used to if you saw her in titanic or sense and sensibility jim carrey plays a very dark depressed and sad individual even sadder than the role he played in cable guy the movie is hard to follow starting out at what you think is the beginning only to be shifted and twisted down a disjointed and confusing path you really do not get the feeling that the two main characters have any chemistry between them at all in order to enjoy a movie you really have to care about the main characters and what happens to them carrey character comes off as desperate and sad and kate winslet character comes off like a crazy witch with a capital b i started not to care whether they got back together or not within minutes of watching suffice it to say this is a good movie if you rent it and drop acid before watching other then that it must be avoided ,1
en,-1220203213,highly recommended the brilliance of the movie lies in the way the emotions of the two main protagonists are dealt with jim carey as joel is his role of a lifetime and clementine played by kate winslet complements him perfectly as the memories are being erased the way joel realizes how much he loves clem is apparent with the fear of losing her that can be seen in his eyes and by his actions clem character has been played brilliantly by kate winslet whose acting skills have always been out of this world how she pulls of those vivid hairstyles and tops are a mystery in itself the locations have been selected with great care and go hand in hand with all the scenes that are being shot this movie has all the flavors of emotions present in it its a unique experience in itself this movie is not only meant for the people who understand love or have been in love its meant for anybody who loves good cinema a must watch ,10
en,-1220203213,one word brilliant this movie amazed me from the very start to the very end the cinematography directing acting anything and everything that contributed to this film was spectacular and had me in complete awe i was speechless when the movie ended i honestly cannot put into words how amazing this film is i highly recommend this film to any type of audience especially since this is not like your average film it is probably hard to categorize into a genre because this film truly is unique ,10
en,-1220203213,wonderful simple as that i could go into a lengthy dissertation about the subtext and details but i do not feel a need to in this instance one word sums it up wonderful a film i will revisit time and time again for the rest of my life and still be touched amused absorbed by every time i see it a it a wonderful life for the new century truly timeless no matter how society turns out progresses regresses i believe people will still be loving this film ### years from now if the word love can be used to describe my affection for this movie then so be it the cast crew may never get the due recognition award wise that this film deserves give them all their oscars now for petes sake but that does not matter because every one who walks away affected by it after they have seen it will regard as up there with the very best that ever been made ,10
en,-1220203213,this is movie is good and fun to watch but i believe it is too overrated so far it is on the top ## at the imdb list which is too overrated to that movie besides it is too complicated i like all of charlie kaufman movies but this one was too complicated to understand as you reach the end you have to re watch it several times or ask someone to simplify for you i would never understood it if my dear friend abdurrahman sleepers did not explain it for me what i like about it is the lovely romantic moments and how will love really makes you do miracles for the ones you love i think this movie is my least favorite of kaufman movies jim carry performance was an ok and not great so is kate ,5
en,-1220203213,by now if you are unfamiliar with the name charlie kaufman in other words if you have spent the last three years in outer space that is undoubtedly a damn shame charlie kaufman is unquestionably one of the most extraordinary and one of the if not the most inventive screenwriters in the game today his previous projects including being john malkovich and adaptation have broken cinematic formulas and expectations alike and in doing so both have become modern day unparalleled masterworks fortunately with his newest effort eternal sunshine of the spotless mind kaufman does not fall far from the level of innovation he emanated with his first two features eternal sunshine of the spotless mind is a strikingly original story that blends both romance and memory loss like no other it is yet another eccentric and aesthetic tale from one of hollywood most gifted writers that all will surely find sharp fresh and cognitive not only has kaufman pieced together a pioneering screenplay on an often adapted subject matter but he has also concocted an aptly named title that has the power to place viewers in a state of surrealism and wonderment right from the get go the title of the picture is taken from a poem entitled eloisa to abelard by alexander pope this historic elegy which kaufman also used in being john malkovich directly refers to the human brain power of recollection reminiscent of both memento and ## first dates eternal sunshine of the spotless mind deals with the loss of memory however kaufman script gives the frequently used topic an appetizing twist on a train to montauk joel barrish jim carrey happens to meet clementine kruczynski kate winslet a candid yet electric woman who more or less seems like she could complete joel in every way the two form a relationship and establish many happy memories together even so in due time their connection comes to a halt clementine becomes bored with joel and joel believes clementine is too dependent immediately after the breakup clementine chooses to have joel erased from her memory she travels to lacuna inc a company that specializes in the futuristic service of memory erasure to seek the help of dr howard mierzwiak tom wilkinson once joel discovers that clementine erased him from her head entirely he reports directly to lacuna for the very same service however once the lacuna employees patrick elijah wood stan mark ruffalo and mary kirsten dunst start wiping out clementine from joel mind their service becomes a disservice joel becomes contrite and changes his mind about the procedure even though joel is unconscious during the entire attempted erasure he consciously tries to retain the memories of his love for clementine within the walls of his own head and attempts to hang on to at least a fragment of what they once had there is no question about it this jim carrey finest work he brings a clear spirited depth to the part of joel making joel jim most stark yet most respectable character role to date even though eternal sunshine may not be one of jim biggest money making endeavors compared to his comedies it certainly puts him on the path of being perceived as an actor who is capable of seriousness at far as earning an oscar nod for ## because of the film early release date and the fierce competition up for the best actor nominations jim will most likely be gypped in addition to carrey career performance the remainder of the ensemble cast fares equally as well kate winslet serves up some of her best non english accented acting as the orange haired and sporadically veclempt clementine sorry for the yiddish slang her work here is arguably better than anything else she has done with the possible exception of her other near astounding #### effort in finding neverland kirsten dunst and mark ruffalo are as faultless as always and both tom wilkinson and elijah wood are as top notch as expected in their respective supporting roles with his superb use of light or more appropriately darkness and his watertight scene transitions director michel gondry has crafted an utter joy of a film that cleverly starts out near the end and then wraps back upon itself by the conclusion overall the quirky yet visual genius of gondry combined with the warped yet brilliant mind of charlie kaufman has undoubtedly resulted in a beautiful and poignant romance the manner in which eternal sunshine blends its romance and comedy gives the film a strong sense of undeniable individuality and makes for an overtly pleasing picture eternal sunshine has the aptitude to tickle your thinking cap sooth your sight and hypnotize your heart beyond any shadow of a doubt eternal sunshine of the spotless mind belongs in the absolute upper echelon of all that is romantic and unique ,9
en,-1343058039,the bourne identity the reason why the bond series had to change and for that bourne needs to be respected i was hostile to this film when it first came out thinking it was going to be no more then the american trying to make their own version of bond much like xxx released in the same year but i so wrong the bourne identity has a simple premise an american assassin jason bourne matt damon has been shot and has amnesia he is found by french fishermen and he goes on a quest to discover his identity his bosses at the cia believed he had died and thought his mission was a failure they were are shocked to see he shows up in zurich and they try to hunt bourne down bourne is shocked to see he has a number of passports thousands of dollars in cash and a gun in a swiss bank security box he discovery he has a nack for language fluent in german and french physically fit and can fight without even thinking he acts like a spy without him knowing it also checking for exits and threats in switzerland he befriends a gypsy marie franka potente he takes him to paris where he lived there the hunt hots up with local police and cia top agents after them they have to hide and work together to solve the mystery they are a lot of positives in this film it has an excellent cast it matt damon first blockbuster and he is good as the spy who is both cold and emotion and also one high alert their is franka potente a very good actress and is a woman caught in the middle of this chase chris cooper is good as the villain and there are other excellent supporting actors brain cox clive owen adewale akinnuoye agbaje and julia stiles the bourne identity is the director doug liman first blockbuster and he shows he is a excellent action director there also some excellent action scene such as the car chase in the mini with ready steady go as the backing song to the fight scenes to the final fight also he does not use shaky cam like paul greengrass did in the sequels it also a part of the trend that x men started out getting an indie director to direct action film and bring strong story to a film there is a fantastic script by tony gilroy and william blake herron they wrote a very intelligence thoughtful script that makes you thing there are themes of memory nature vs nurture the all seeing eye of the cia and their willingness to be ruthless it is also unusual for a blockbuster because it makes out that the americans or at least the cia as the bad guys it has a left wing political stance which greengrass continues it an excellent film and needs multipal viewings to truly understand it ,9
en,1371628345,brad bird proves with the charming effort that he is one of the best directors currently working in the field of animation and pixar once again shows why they are the leaders of the pack ratatouille tells the tale of a young rat named remy voiced by patton oswalt who longs to be more than what he is inspired by the great chef august gusteau brad garrett remy discovers his passion for food and cooking in quick succession a series of events sees him separated from his family and all alone in the great city of paris remy finds himself drawn to the restaurant of his idol gusteau who has since passed away in fact gusteau stays on in the film as a spirital guide for remy in the process another tale begins to emerge as a young man called linguini lou romano also finds himself at gusteau seeking a job and in turn the two end up being tied to each other fates this movie successfully infuses a delightful blend of physical comedy and savvy wit humour combined with great animation a lovely score from michael giacchino and great voice over work from janeane garofalo as the feisty young female chef colette ian holm as the devilish villain of the piece chef skinner and peter o toole who was a master stroke of casting as the king of all critics anton ego brad bird is able to provide this animated feature with a level of depth and intelligence which adult audiences can appreciate and enjoy ratatouille proves that animated films can move beyond the cute and cuddly realm for which many find themselves stuck in granted children can enjoy this movie and this is certainly plenty of moments for them to soak up but what impressed me most about this film was the fact that it had layers of thought behind it which appealed to my sensibility highly recommended ,9
en,1371628345,ratatouille is in a word brilliant just about everything in this movie is flawless you would think that with so many great pixar films it cannot get much better but this movie proves it can the animation is borderline unbelievable literally it was dazzling the attention to detail is astounding the voice acting shows nothing but great talent the concept is clever and humorous the entertainment level is high the script is witty this may very well be the best animated film ever brad bird is some sort of genius if this does not win best animated feature at the academy awards which at this point seems insane it will make me very angry i feel this film can be enjoyed by just about anyone see it i promise you anyone that you will enjoy it or at least admire it for being so beautiful in animation ## ## ,10
en,1371628345,i recently saw this movie because i thought it would be cute movie rats mice pigs fish monsters they all can be so cute i thought the movie was far from magical this movie had problems because it tried too hard to combine things that are hard to combine such as rats cooking paris the english language and in the same time humor biggest overall disappointment was how paris was introduced unfortunately in a very american manner as the so called city of lights and high cuisine i do not think the essence of paris was captured in a nice way and since the setting was in paris this influenced the whole movie in a negative manner also speaking french english does not help much with creating a french atmosphere at all i liked the rat because as always humans look a bit creepy when animated in this manner at one point i was a bit grossed out by the rats because although it just a cartoon and it supposed to be cute i think i find mice sort of cute but rats can be very big and as cute as you try to make them it may still gross some people like myself out the humor was poorly done it borrowed a lot from other movies and i found the jokes forced and not so funny so pixar ran into a little bit of trouble in this movie because they tried to go in unfamiliar waters so to say they tried to find an original story and i guess with all the popularity of cooking shows they thought it would be a good idea however they could have tried harder if they wanted to capture paris in a good romantic manner rather than an american cheesy manner no pun intended cheese rats make it funny in a more subtle way make the characters less boring and more dynamic paris could be a great setting for a cartoon if done properly unfortunately this was not accomplished and the result is thus mediocre at best if you want to see a beautiful animation in a very frech spirit then i recommend the triplets of belleville ,4

en,85772094,just in time to rally against all those debeers commercials and put fire on the save darfur flame darfur or whatever african nation is falling apart at the moment this winter brings us blood diamond this movie is about conflict diamonds precious jewels whose sale and illegal trafficking funds war in africa and comes at the cost of many human lives with plenty of action a tad of moral and social philosophy and not surprisingly political commentary this film is what you might expect from hollywood when it trying to show how honest it can be and what real issues it can portray in other words blood diamond is this year syriana but fanaticism humanitarianism and hype aside this is still a very good movie it portrays the chaos in africa much like the constant gardener mixed in with better and more gripping action and the drama of city of god now unlike the constant gardener slow mysterious pace and conflicted heroes of justin and tessa quayle that take too long to develop blood diamond masterfully interweaves the tales of a father trying to find his family a diamond smuggler and a journalist into a fast paced story it captures the heart of city of god and the sadness of innocent children eyes but in a much more streamlined way things are not spelled out for the viewer attraction danger and death are realistic and unsaid instead of woven into clich d dialogue and finally unlike syriana there are not too many characters and you actually care about them as they go through the war zone of sierra leone in #### two big stars headline the show in jennifer connelly and leonard dicaprio but both work magic in their roles largely unknown djimon hounsou who radiates the passion and energy of a just and honest family man in dynamic times of crisis rounds out the main characters connelly never fails to impress and does well with her smaller but effective role while dicaprio takes on a much more challenging character along the lines of the gangs of new york amsterdam vallon and the aviator howard hughes he proves that he is not scorsese second or new deniro but can still make the screen sizzle on his own the diamond smuggling danny archer is not just a gun totting careless opportunist he has a past a philosophy that goes beyond screw everything and he is not invincible nothing that is revealed about his character is left to be implausible or unexplained while still retaining depth and unpredictability dicaprio compliments his costars very well and masterfully jumps between the different roles archer is forced to take on as smoothly as a flick of a light switch he goes from saving a child to ruthlessly fighting the child father this film does lapse into a bit of predictable cinematography with scenes of the sunset and convoys of cars that feel lifted from elsewhere but is otherwise more raw and original than one might expect everything from dicaprio accent south african not british to the minimal portrayal of the diamond industry itself indicates that this is not a run of the mill political thriller that tells you what to think or how wrong something is like a good book or any good story for that matter it shows rather than tells it feels rather than kisses and sleeps around and it breathes and bleeds rather than do fancy cut scenes for suspense in the end the viewer is more open to making up his or her mind as to what he would do in these circumstances and times the movie needs no tagline but can be summarized by one motif and acronym tia this is africa ,8
en,85772094,dicaprio role play was better than i expected the screenplay was dumbed down clich as hollywood usually does with good real life stories but it was still good however jennifer connelly role or her acting i cannot tell was so bad as it ruined the film for me her portrayal of an embedded reporter was so unbelievable as to take away from the storyline and dicaprio role she played the clich moralistic smug reporter that was so far from reality as to be comical she should have watched some iraq video filings from embedded reporters or just about any cnn foreign war correspondent clip to see how neutral and bonded with trust to their subjects they are in real life the film also made only fleeting reference to the artificial valuing of diamonds by debeers yet promoted more blame on u s consumers that illogical fact comparison also stuck out in the film could not help feeling the whole film as this movie had so much potential to be better were it not for the mediocre screenplay shallow storyline and connelly totally miscast in that role or just simply bad acting direction ,9

en,134880575,i had no expectations for this movie i had not seen the ads or heard the buzz i wanted to go to the movies had the choice between pink panther and walk the line and having seen the pink panther ads i picked this one i went in expecting another biopic ok to watch once not remarkable in any way just a quick fast forward through the biggest moments of johnny cash career i was wrong the focus on johnny and june is what makes this movie so compelling it serves as a filter every detail about johnny career does not have be shown we do not have to follow his life until he dies and so forth instead we can focus on the topic of johnny and june and the movie has a story with a structure and a happy ending it also serves to make this movie more intimate than most biopics we see johnny personal life not only in short clips but as a continuing theme throughout it makes him more human stellar performances from both lead actors particularly reese witherspoon who portrays june compelling personality very well the chemistry between the two lead actors is great the childhood scenes also worked in most biopics these are very short and seem like gratuitous foreshadowing of the star later career see the otherwise brilliant man on the moon for example here that was avoided by focusing on the brother tragic death that and the father attitude served to explain cash problems later in life and they were not overdone the death was touching but not too dramatized it seemed fairly realistic we got to see just enough of jack and the family dynamics to understand how devastating his death would be for the others the only thing i wanted to see more of was the courtship between johnny and viv there never seemed to be any chemistry between them as all we saw were their marital problems it would have been nice to know why johnny fell in love with her and what made them get married it would have humanized viv a bit as it is she comes off as a rather demanding woman who does not understand johnny devotion to music i am not saying she had no reason to complain but this aspect was overdone in my opinion the music scenes worked well to set the tone and serve as transitions throughout the movie joaquin phoenix and reese witherspoon shine on stage and their chemistry is especially good in these scenes all in all this is one of the best biopics i have ever seen highly recommended ,9
en,134880575,i first heard about this film on the internet way back when it was announced that they were going to make the biopic of johnny cash i did not think too much of it and as months went by i started becoming more and more interested in it i thought joaquin phoenix was great in a lot he had done since gladiator and was becoming a fan reese witherspoon i aways saw as a girl next door type so i was up in the air with her playing june carter when i finally saw a preview of the film i immediately wanted to check it out do to my curiosity and speculation something inside me wanted this to be good so i checked it out i was hooked from beginning to end and i even found myself toe tapping to the music i am not even a fan of country the performances are outstanding with both phoenix and witherspoon at their career defining best i am pulling for both to win the oscars for actor and actress but am shocked to find out it is not up for best picture it an outrage because whether the academy agrees or not apparently not this is the best picture of #### see it for an entertaining story music drama and overall great film ,10
en,134880575,written and directed by james mangold walk the line charts the life and times of renowned country music artist jonny cash the film stars joaquin phoenix as cash and reese witherspoon as june carter the woman with whom cash has an elaborate romance despite likable performances by phoenix and witherspoon walk the line is wholly formulaic unfolding like a superhero origins tale the film watches as cash rises from humble beginnings dons a costume becomes a star drug addict and then lover fidelity and faithfulness are the film chief preoccupations the walking the line of its title cash called upon to be faithful to a wife he betrays and then a lover he gives up a serious drug addiction to be with though a by the numbers biopic and though it completely flattens and simplifies a rich life walk the line is entertaining glossy and ends on a cute note # # ## worth one viewing see tender mercies ,7
en,-24241856,the best way to watch this movie is to watch it on dvd actually your own dvd not a second hand one if possible the reason well in that way at least you try to watch it with patience i mean after all you must have spent more than ## well that what the boxset costs in my case that helped me enormously when i first ordered the boxset on the internet i was so excited that i am finally going to watch the greatest movie of all time then about # weeks later the dvd arrived i waited until the weekend i am a highschool student and watched the first godfather my first experience of it was well disappointing it was boring and the story went too slow i was not just disappointed i was furious furious about all the good reviews about this movies but then with my incredible patience i watched it again i mean after all i spent a huge amount of money on this i had to understand what it was about second time was also bad then i watched it for the thrid time and it was incredible it was fantasitc suddenly i could see all the meanings of the movies and from then one i watched it again and again i must have watched it more than ## times now but i will never get bored so please if you are watching the godfather trilogy for the first time and you are young buy the boxset it will help trust me ,10
en,-24241856,much of my male wisdom and philosophy on life is derived from the godfather it is one of the most powerful poetic dramatic stories in history elevated from pulp to high art by a brilliant ensemble cast mythical direction and a riveting script brando is forever enshrined by his performance as don vito head of the powerful corleone crime family al pacino stars in his breakthrough role as the don son michael who is ironically transplanted from war hero to mafia chief during a pivotal existential murder scene it is a comment on the fallibility of the american dream how every good boy has the capacity for bad every character resonates with authenticity every subplot relates back to the theme of redemption through dedication to family the godfather above all raises moral questions about how far one should go for their family it is a tribute to an age long before organized crime had been washed away by drugs and rock and roll when loyalty was ensured through family connections and the power of the mafia was as strong as the national government a film that is truly epic in scope and all encompassing in wisdom a masterpiece ,10

en,-1924172856, spoilers contained within this review ok let me preface my review by saying i overall enjoyed the movie if i had not read the books many times i probably would have really enjoyed the movie but i do not think i would have enjoyed it as much as the first that sentence is misleading however i did in fact enjoy the two towers it just left me with a sour taste in my mouth read below for details the fellowship of the ring was in my opinion one of the best movies i would ever seen it did not remain entirely true to the books but there were few additions and a few ommisions that did not have an overall effect on important characters in the story to come the biggest problem with the two towers is that as has been said before some of the added material is unnecessary some not necessary but interesting things were left out and a few important plot changes were made to me there were four big changes that are worth noting and i will in the increasing order in which they bothered me first the battle with the wargs giant hyenas was an addition and a reasonably significant one for the most part i would say this was a welcome addition more than anything else it was simply exciting however it could have done without aragorn going over the cliff second the elves being included in the battle of helm deep was neither here nor there for me it really added nothing to the story but it did not take much away from it either third was king theoden being possessed by saruman this is where the changes start hurting tolkein character development and will ultimately put a damper on the character development for the next installment as mentioned in an earlier review theoden breaks free from wormtongue on his own which shows his will he is also a much stronger king in the books lastly and to its largest detriment is the change in the way faramir handles the situation with the ring as we learn later on faramir is the highly unfavored son of the leader of gondor because he was weaker than boromir i understand jackson justification of making faramir want to please his father but that is simply not how faramir character is drawn up he is noble and wise he intuitively knows what happened to boromir and knows he cannot make the same mistake unfortunately this happens and moves on until the movie is nearly over and it left me with a sour taste in my mouth it just was not necessary and will hurt the character development across the films for people familiar with the books there are a lot of other obvious changes from the book but these are overall less significant the development of the ents is obviously lacking in the film but the overall effect is not much different the reason the changes in fellowship of the ring were so tolerable was because the end result was still the same as the book ultimately the same thing happens with the two towers it leaves us about ## ## pages before the end of the novel but the path we take to get there changes things that will have an impact past the scope of this film on its own now that i have gotten that gripe out of the way i will discuss some other things gollum smeagol was produced exquisitely his interaction with frodo and sam is very believable and his facial expressions and humanity hobbity are both impecable the battle scenes in general are impressive to say the least but you wo not find anything like the fight sequence in moria with the cave troll or the duel between aragorn and the uruk hai fighter like you did in fellowship the battles in the two towers are bigger but somehow less exciting it comparaing apples to oranges though what the two towers does in its battle sequences it does very very well as far as large scale battles go there is not much that can rival the execution of the battle at helm deep the opening scene with gandalf is a good way to get the audiences pulse going and the scene showing his return to gimli aragorn and legolas and the fight on top of the mountain was amazing my conclusion is simply that i must see the movie again knowing what to expect this way the changes wo not distract me and i will be able to concentrate on exactly what is happening in front of me ,5

en,-1261130941,talk about spoilers when i saw this movie it was spoiled for me and i could have committed murder no jury would have convicted me after learning there was a secret to the plot i made a point of not reading any reviews nor talking to anyone who had seen it i finally got a chance to go settled into my seat and as the lights dimmed excited for a good story i barely noticed the two men who sat down behind me i could not miss these two jack asses a few moments later though as the movie began and one of them said to the other so when did you figure out that bruce and proceeded to discuss the secret of the movie the whole theater almost saw dead people the viewing was ruined for me it will always be marred by the memory of two jerks with no movie going manners who revealed the big secret robbing me of the suspenseful movie going experience ever happen to you ,8
en,-1261130941,m night shyamalan returns to directing for his second effort after the disappointing wide awake which he directed for release in #### his second film the sixth sense was a staggering success that rocketed shyamalan to the very top of the filmmaking world bruce willis plays malcolm crowe a child psychologist who takes on the excessively challenging task of helping young cole sear played with amazing skill by haley joel osment a boy who is cursed with the ability to see dead people complicating the plot is the fact that malcolm once had a young boy as a patient with the same problem and he was unable to help him and he is now afraid that the same thing will happen with cole every individual scene in the sixth sense is saturated with cinematic trickery giving even the liveliest settings a birthday party for example a strikingly eerie feel because of that even though the film is not non stop relentless thrills and scares it never lets the audience relax which is one of the main things that make it such a good movie besides that not only does the film avoid excessive gore and tasteless violence it also provides the perfect premise for presenting the small amount of gore that it does contain cole is able to see people who are dead and naturally he sees them as they look when they died this provides for some seriously scary moments such as when he is using the bathroom in the middle of the night and the woman walks by the doorway very simple but coupled with the startling sound effects at that moment this is one of the scariest scenes seen in movies in recent years the sixth sense had a incredibly imaginative and original story and it was presented with great skill it has a certain quality that very few movies of this type have most movies try to keep the audience guessing wild things but in the sixth sense the audience does not even know that something is amiss before the breathtaking plot twist the ending is not even considered as a possibility however once the ending is realized a number of questions begin to arise spoiler how could malcolm have lived for so long as a dead person without noticing anything strange would not it seem strange to him that no one was able to see him since that one night when he got shot by his former patient he could not possibly interact with anyone in the world of the living and even if he could why did not his fiancee acknowledge him at the restaurant i mean assuming that he does not know he dead questions like this are usually inevitable with a movie like the sixth sense and i think that they could have been answered if the film would have gone into how it possible for these people not to know that they are dead even though the back of their head is blown out or half of the skin on their face has been burned off do they just perceive everything as being normal i do not know but either way despite trivial shortcomings like this the sixth sense is a groundbreaking supernatural thriller and you see something new in it every time you watch it that a rare quality that not many movies have do not miss this one ,10
en,-1261130941,out of all the movies i have ever seen only two movies have had endings that managed to take me completely by surprise those two are diabolique and seven well make this movie the third i am not even going to hint as to what happens in respect for an amazing script amazing performances and a storyline that will have you believing the unbelievable without even thinking twice just when nothing else this summer or year for that matter looked like it was going to top blair witch as the best movie along comes sixth sense if you are debating going to see it just go it worth the price of the ticket and will have you walking out of the theater stunned unless a real miracle happens it may be a long time before another movie is released that has quite the ending as this one but believe me it not just the ending that will have you completely captivated amazingly for a bruce willis movie there are probably only two words that would be edited out if this were to be showing on tv look to see this movie winning big at the oscars unless like what usually happens the academy decides it was too dark and nominates the haunting scream ### the geriatric slasher or something equally brainless and pointless ,10
en,-1261130941,as the summary line says the #th sense is by far the best movie of #### hands down it has everything intelligence a few pretty creepy moments and some of the best acting i have ever seen coming from the very young and very talented haley joel osment who outacts nearly every actor i have ever seen and the ending well you will just have to see the movie to believe it go see this movie go see it again and again ,10
en,-1261130941,bruce bruce bruce who would of thought that this one liner action thriller gets the girl type actor could pull off such a deep performance i did knew it all along and nobody could have done it better if he does not get a best actor nod for this it will only remind me of jim carey overlooked genius from last year i would see this movie again already have plans to go it held me after the first ten minutes and made me jump laugh and cry everyone around me was reacting the same way and the theater was shoulder to shoulder the child actor haley is very believable and the actress who plays his mother collette deserves a supporting actress nomination the only competition bruce has for best actor is his diminutive co star all great efforts and an ending that will knock your socks off ,10
en,-1261130941,i have to confess i did not figure the plot out in the first ## minutes but that because i was so bored i did not waste neurons trying to figure it out this film has no alternative to being boring because the screenplay has to carefully keep bruce willis from engaging in conversation with any other adult for nearly two screen hours this give it an oddly staid funeral parlor cache between the gripping beginning and end sequences that said it is artistically done well edited and well acted despite being so drawn out i agree with other reviewers that it would have been perfect for a ## minute twilight zone episode or longer treatment at the hand of alfred hitchcock ,5
en,-679719607,this has to be one of my highlight movies i have seen during summer took me forever to get it and i regret not being able to see it in the theaters the movie is very colorful and the robert downey jr does an excellent job as a thief in the wrong place at the right time the narratives are filled with humor and the entire situation makes light of even the darkest situation this is definitely a light hearted movie and should be watched by people who crave a bit more meat in their comedy this is a movie that i recommend viewers of all ages watch it at least once simply put to me this is a movie to own and works well for group sessions ,10
en,-1321113265,i have to say this film is great to watch it has a marvellous opening sequence though not as good as ryan omaha sequence that has you enthralled from the first minute the unusual approach on focusing on snipers made for a refreshing twist and i think gave more suspense waiting as each person aimed was nailbiting the only actor who let the film down i think was probably rachel weisz far too posh to be a peasant russian resistance fighter she simpered her way throughout the film with probably one facial expression all the way the star of the film was undoubtably gabriel thomson who i believe was ## at the time unlike daniel radcliffe in hp thomson is never once wooden and steals the show he displayed some amazingly mature acting and emotions the action sequences were wonderful as were the sets but and this is a big phobia of mine they managed to sneak a sex scene in i do not know how they did it but it was there and for me totally ruined all tension and emotion they had built up so well lord knows how sex fits in with the battle of stalingrad but it was not necessary and spoilt the film other than weisz and the sex scene this film would be a near perfect war film ,4
en,-1321113265,maybe there something nostalgic about russians and german characters not speaking with their proper accents in war movies because that how a lot of war movies used to be made but it something that just gets on my nerves the opening battle scenes are on par with saving private ryan the tension of the two snipers duel is nail biting but the love triangle subplot is forgettable and the filmmakers fail to utilize and comment on the propaganda used by both the soviets and germans in any meaningful way the movie does get points for showcasing the eastern front of the european theater hollywood would have us believe the us won the war single handedly but the russians were in fact instrumental in the defeat of the nazis still i just cannot get past those russians with british accents # ## if you would like to see movies that highlight the eastern front even more effectively check out sam peckinpah cross of iron from #### or the german made stalingrad from #### ,7
en,73962833,for those of you who say that this is nothing like the godfather you are right the godfather is about the mob life at the top white collar goodfellas is about mob life at the working man level blue collar both show their home life and their working life but are very different in the godfather corleone gave the word or in some cases the nod to have someone whacked in goodfellas these guys were the ones who carried out the order to whack someone so you can not really compare the two i like the idea of watching a mob movie and not hearing that stereotypical italian music playing in the background the regular music of the day is what is more believable and enjoyable at least to me we are lucky to get to see deniro is both of these films and what a performance he gives no surprise liotta is charming as the new kid on the mobster block though his character never kills he does just about everything else pesci steals the show as the sick f ker who can kill without any thought lorraine bracco is stunning as liotta wife it is interesting to see the two of them as they get swepted away in the muck of the underworld she knows she should get away from this but cannot because it kind of a turn on possible spoilers the two best scenes for me is when the camera is following liotta and bracco through a restaurant from the alley to their table without a cut all done with such a grand flow perfectly shot with then he kissed me playing in the background the other is when all those mob buddies start showing up dead one by one with that erie music playing in the background cannot think of the song but is was terrific and terrifying at the same time end of spoiler yes the godfather was brilliant but do not rule out goodfellas view it as the other side of the coin in the mob world perfectly acted scripted and shot and with a killer soundtrack to boot watch it or get whacked ,10
en,73962833,i am sorry godfather # and # but this movie is better in my opinion it really is a tough choice to make since all three movies are perfect in my opinion but i just like this one the most if you have never seen this why not you are missing out robert de nero and joe pesci are at their absolute best in this when i recommend a movie to someone that has either of those guys this is the movie i always say first however it should be noted that a performance in this that people underrate is ray liotta he fantastic as henry hill and he is way more interesting than the real life henry hill who has been accused to have lied about and embellished his mafia stories martin scorsese has never done a better movie than this so if you have not seen this then go see it ,10
en,73962833,goodfellas well perhaps one of the best movies ever made it holds a serene sense of the life of the modern gangster in ways that movies like godfather although i enjoy it intensly are not able to do even like henry hill says in the movie there were no curses like you see in the movies your killers came to you with smiles we are getting a fact based movie which is hard to believe but is true the book wiseguy which goodfellas comes from is nearly identical to the movie we are not getting a novel like in puzzos godfather but an actual account of the mafia in america and its done masterfully who can deny the copacabana shots its just great to go for several minutes with such intricate cinematics is wonderful and unlike other movies which do this with special effects shots we get an intense and moving moment with only the characters it is just wonderful the movie is gatsby gone arwy and if nothing else a masterpiece of american cinema,10
en,73962833,one of the best films i have ever seen outstanding performances by deniro pesci and liotta follows the book almost word for word the best glimpse inside the mob that hollywood has ever offered us it a great movie highly recommended,10
en,73962833,this is the best movie ever do yourself a favor and watch it you wo not be disappointed there are so many classic scenes and characters need i say more just look at the high imdb score with over ### ### reviews enjoy it this is the best movie ever do yourself a favor and watch it you wo not be disappointed there are so many classic scenes and characters need i say more just look at the high imdb score with over ### ### reviews enjoy it ,10
en,-1639893422,i was a little put off with the thought of having to read the entire movie although i have to admit it was not that bad it was not filled with long spoken dialect i loved the set location and the characters but i felt the story line left me wanting more it felt like something was missing for me to really be captured in it its not a movie i would say i would watch again the ending left me a little out of sorts as i wondered about the children that were not taken where are they now and why were they not taken or worse killed also my thoughts kept going back to the mother in law that was nagging at her son in law what happened to her ,5

en,-432074910,who among us has not at one time or another dreamed of one day chucking the whole corporate rat race adult responsibility thing and moving to an isolated cabin in the woods where we would be free to get in touch with our inner selves and become one with nature yet even though many of us have fantasized about doing such a thing few of us have had the intestinal fortitude or psychological wherewithal to actually go out and do it well christopher mccandless actually did go out and do it though with sadly tragic results for both the young man and those dearest to him at the age of ## mccandless could have had the life of privilege comfort and financial success natural to one who had just graduated with honors from a prestigious institution like emory university especially one with wealthy parents instead he chose a different path for himself one that would reject the materialistic values of the world around him and send him on a journey of self discovery which despite the best of intentions would prove fatal to him in the long run over a two year period from #### to #### chris traveled all across north america on foot by kayak by bumming rides off strangers finally ending up in the wilderness of alaska where he was to meet his tragic fate along the way he encountered numerous colorful characters who made a mark on his heart this adventure was popularized in the best selling book into the wild by jon krakauer who reconstructed mccandless experiences largely from notes and journal entries left behind by the young man and through interviews with certain key players in the drama for the movie version writer director sean penn has made chris devoted sister carine the narrator and chief commentator on the action it is through her reflections that we come to understand some of the reasoning behind chris remarkable willingness to forego all the creature comforts of the modern world that the rest of us seem to cling to so tenaciously as with any tale of a picaresque nature into the wild is more a series of vignettes than a fully fleshed out drama and thus it has an occasional tendency to ramble and wander aimlessly yet its narrative looseness is clearly a large part of the story charm moreover penn keeps it tightly knit together through the narration the use of flashbacks the scenes involving chris parents and the mesmerizing fluidity of the camera work and naturally the evocative richly variegated landscapes against which the story unfolds play a crucial role in the overall richness of the film some have charged the movie with romanticizing and glorifying an individual who was arguably sociopathic and whose actions and decisions ultimately led to his own death yet while penn clearly wants us to identify with chris sense of idealism and carpe diem spirit the filmmaker also acknowledges that there are some serious psychological issues at play here mostly brought on by the young man being raised by two obviously dysfunctional parents yet the movie is also about how important it is for us to forgive those who have wronged us and to not allow bitterness to determine the course of our lives with his boyish looks and unprepossessing manner emile hirsch embodies the devil may care spirit of what is essentially a ##th century version of henry david thoreau in relatively small but crucial roles william hurt and marcia gay harden leave an indelible mark as chris parents the many individuals he meets along the way are embodied by brian h dierker catherine keener vince vaughn and most memorably hal holbrook heartbreaking in his oscar nominated performance as an old desert dweller who offers to adopt chris as his son in the end into the wild can be read as much as a cautionary tale as one championing the cause of unbridled individuality like grizzly man it shows how an obsession with nature and an unrealistic disdain for civilization can lead to disastrous consequences for individuals unequipped to deal with the harsh realities of the natural world if anything both films serve as a call for reasonableness and balance in determining mankind proper place in the overall scheme of things ,8
en,-432074910,the best directed movie from actor auteur sean penn since #### underrated the indian runner this is a visually gorgeous travelogue showing the sites of america though the yearning eyes of christopher mccandless a suburban college graduate turned intrepid idealist who ditches everything giving his law school funds to charity for a trip to alaska for what he considers the ultimate freedom eventually without a car or money mccandless meets a hippie couple a charming tractor driver and a dear old man with a tragic past each character serves as a peripheral warning for mccandless that his ill prepared trek might not be very safe and even those not familiar with the true story can assume it a one way ticket from riding a kayak through the colorado river to climbing gorgeous mountaintops director penn shows more style than struggle for the main character whose journey is mostly aesthetic and backed by original music by eddie vedder dwells in a glossy documentary style giving the isolated journey a much too rosy outlook except scenes in the present as mccandless resides in a junked magic bus in the middle of nowhere alaska and eventually runs out of food and sanity with a determined scruffy puppy countenance emile hirsch balances dedicated traveler and naive optimist decently enough with mistakes equaling accomplishments he never shown too perfectly despite the heavy handed narration by his sister who subliminally compares him to the ever quotable philosophers instead of a normal guy on an abnormal quest his obstacles include skinning a moose before flies take over getting stuck in mexico and the temptation to sleep with a sixteen year old kristen stewart running at a breezy two and a half hours this is a trip worth taking and although there a clear anti capitalist message throughout the film made by a politically polarizing celebrity is never one dimensional or one sided anyone yearning to escape from the drudgery of city life into the wonders of nature will enjoy this quest there a lot to experience with enough time for everything to matter for more reviews www cultfilmfreaks com,10

en,-432074910,maybe the older i get the less patience i have with people who do willfully stupid things having said that i cannot fault the acting or direction of this film the cast is very good penn obviously knows how to direct his actors the vistas are magnificent the problem for me is the central character is someone who is smart enough to know better but goes ahead and does the stupid thing anyway i try to chalk it up to youth but the scope of the lead character stupidity is so great i find myself unable to do it ok i think maybe when i was ## i would have done something like that given his family life but the answer always comes back hell no i was not even that stupid at twelve christopher mccandless played by emile hirsch has a mommy and daddy played by marcia gay hardon william hurt who fought a lot while he was growing up that unfortunate he graduates college and decides most people lead empty lives hey what a concept and because he must have a tremendous amount of rage towards mom and dad he decides to hell with it all tears up his credit card and money or gives it away ok that kind of cool and thinks screw it he going on the road a free spirit what is his ultimate goal alaska why who knows maybe it because that as far away as he can get from mom and dad who despite the fact they fought like cats and dogs are totally anguished over the disappearance of their son who never never tells them where he went or communicates with them once he never even tells his sister the person he supposedly loves what he intends to do so he not just stupid he unforgiving yay so this over privileged clueless ## year old with a liking for thoreau byron who probably would not have been caught dead in alaska at least not that unprepared sets off on his trek for a very cold place and on the way behold he encounters a bunch of colorful eccentrics whose lives he touches briefly and magically and then he flits away because he is after all a free spirit evidently someone has neglected to tell chris the ####s are over because he even gives himself a wifty ####s name super tramp eventually chris gets to alaska and the guy who drops him off as far into the wilderness as he will dare to go says to him i will see you in the spring if you are still alive does that faze chris no because someone kind of sort of told him how to smoke moose meat the wonders of nature await besides all he has to do is cross that little creek of course during the spring melt the thing becomes a raging river trapping him on the what turns out to be the wrong side of where he should be oops he finds an abandoned bus to live in and botches smoking his moose meat because maggots take over very quickly not to worry he got his little local flora and fauna book so he can live off fruits and roots and plants that are not poisonous except he really sucks at using the book and he does end up eating a highly toxic plant and in his starved condition he does not last too much longer after that he is so sick at the end even a grizzly bear turns his nose up at him i am supposed to feel sorry for this guy he was just as self indulgent and selfish as the world he choose to reject and being clueless nature culled him from the herd end of story ,3

en,-2074471064,there not much original in this story of a high school kid who yearns to send rockets into the sky rather than work in the local coal mine it all pretty formulaic but formulas are in such common use because they are dependable who would argue with a squared plus b squared equals c squared they get the job done jake gyllenhaal is the obsessed kid he looks ordinary and is fascinated by an arcane subject like rocket design in a way that only a teen ager can be he lives in a small west virginia town where everything revolves around the coal mine which like the town itself is moribund he has his mother love of course but his dad chris cooper grew up in the mines and is now a kind of manager and gyllenhaal aspirations occasion some irritation in his father cooper wants him to come down in the mines like everybody else instead of fooling around with this nonsense and worshiping werner von braun cooper makes a particular point of never attending any of gyllenhaal experimental launches gyllenhaal teacher laura dern recognizes that the kid is a wizard and supports him at first the others in town treat him and his interest in rocketry as half loony one by one though the kid draws others into his sphere a pimply nerd and a handful of other alienated students join him in building rockets that at first explode if anyone looks cross eyed at them eventually others including a black machinist at the mine help him build rockets that act not like inverted pendulums but like rockets there are naturally some obstacles along the way his father constant belittling of him for one thing and then there the matter of finding money for materials which leads to one or two comic incidents then his father is injured in a mine accident for which the company wo not pay so gyllenhaal must drop out of school and go down and work in the mines for a while accompanied by plangent violins but in the end he is sent to the science fair in indianapolis where he displays his rockets and their components the score swells into an orgasmic triumph it the international geophysical year of #### does gyllenhaal win first prize no power on earth could force an answer from me gyllenhaal returns to coal community wva where he sets off one last big celebratory rocket the entire town of coaldorf has attended everyone bursting with pride gyllenhaal dedicates this rocket to everyone who has helped him in his travails listing them one by one before finally reaching my father and lo there is dad edging his way to the front of the crowd final shot the space shuttle being launched from cape canaveral it got every clich in the book but it kind of sweet too none of the performances stands out although chris cooper does a good job with the role of the all but fossilized but gentle father he a pretty good actor of all the films about adolescents finding their own voice this one is about average but it suitable for family viewing the kids will understand it as well as the adults and although their minds may not be exalted neither will they be turned into suppurating boils the location shooting is good too leading us to understand why gyllenhaal would like to leave coalton sur mont behind him ,7
en,-583022231,incredible film watched it last night in imax and it was action packed from beginning to end i have been a fan of the trek series since the ## and have watched all of the tv shows and films this is a reboot something new and fresh and it meant to be if you are fan of the series and films watch it you wont be disappointed if you have never seen a trek film before you will be entertained and most likely become an instant fan the characters are very likable and portray the old crew surprisingly well the space scenes and cgi were excellent i could not have asked for better i am ready to watch it again and looking forward to another film with this cast ,9
en,-583022231,outstanding and brilliant in terms of comparison to a non epic star trek film it had amazing cgi thorough immersion smooth plot and character establishment and exciting build up now let talk about how a modern day movie could contain the old star trek crew without william shatner and the ridiculous computer sounds it did not try this film did not compete with old ideas and characters it applauded them it celebrated them if you enjoyed the original star trek series you will love every actor they cast especially bones wow you will want to jump out of your seat at cryptic references to the original episodes and adventures the technology has been updated thank god but in a very comfortable way ncc #### is definitely a vision of the future from current day technological theory but it still looks vintage and again applauds the ship from the first series i would equate it to how the prowler is a modern car but celebrates the old muscle cars i so enjoyed this film that i am going to see it in the theater several more times i love seeing a movie that gets a hesitant standing ovation and lasting applause how infrequent it happens today well done cast and crew well done ,10
en,-583022231,people must be getting pretty desperate for good movies if they like this film i thought spock and scotty were pretty good and the special effects were great but the plot ruins it and i am no trekkie i just like films that make sense the plot has so many contradictions and is based on so many coincidences that you would have to turn off your brain to like it and i am not talking willing suspension of disbelief here i am talking full cranial lobotomy the only way it good is in comparison to recent stinkers pirates of the caribbean# # spidey# etc here a list of the terrible plot elements # nero ship exiting the black hole right where kirk father ship is ok coincidences happen so one coincidence is acceptable in any film so let give them one pass however it pretty convenient that in all the vastness of space nero who wants to avenge spock failure to save romulus comes out of the black hole right where the father of spock best friend is located # on # different occasions kirk almost dies by nearly falling off a ledge #st kid kirk and the car ride #nd when the parachute almost pulls him off the drilling platform #rd when the romulan tries to stomp him off the platform #th when he does not quite make a jump in nero ship #th when the romulan picks him up he shoots the romulan and he falls right back down # nero never warns romulus that their star will explode the great thing about going back in time is that you can prevent terrible things from happening in the future right you would think the #st thing nero would do after going back in time is fly to romulus and warn them of the danger but no after blowing up the kelvin nero just waits there for ## years for spock to arrive you would think that just once during those ## years he might think hey this is pretty dumb i am waiting here to get back at spock for letting my planet blow up maybe instead of sitting here i will fly over and warn everybody then i will have nothing to be mad about # kirk warning captain pike that they are flying into a trap serves no purpose kirk warns pike that vulcan is not encountering a natural disaster but is being attacked by an alien ship the problem is that by the time pike convinced they have already at vulcan and they get attacked anyway # pike should not have to be warned anyway pike did his dissertation on the battle that destroyed the kelvin he would certainly come to the same conclusion that kirk does # after pike is captured kirk immediately reverses himself and goes against the advice he gave pike in the scene just referred to kirk tells pike that they will certainly be destroyed if they take on the alien ship that destroyed the kelvin a few scenes later kirk knows that his suspicions were right however at this point kirk now strangely does not heed his own warnings that attacking nero ship means certain death and argues so strongly with spock in support of attacking nero ship that spock has him ejected from the enterprise # why do not the vulcans attack the space drill themselves # after young spock sends kirk to vulcan ice moon in an escape pod kirk just happens to land within a mile of where old spock ice cave is come on we are talking about an entire moon here that like an astronaut ejecting from the internationalspacestation not in the movie the one that orbiting the earth and landing a mile from where his mother lives # there no reason nero would not have kept spock in his own ship in the #st place it seems like spock would have had a pretty good view of vulcan from nero ship and nero would have had the fun of laughing at him too plus nero would not have to worry about old spock foiling his plans later on maybe this one can be ignored we have already established that nero is a complete idiot ## spock ice cave just happens to be next to where scotty is stationed not only does kirk land right next to old spock but they seem to be a short walk from where scotty is in fact if old spock had done some hiking before meeting kirk he would have discovered scotty on his own which would have allowed him to warn vulcan of nero attack ## kirk is able to cause spock to lose his cool in about a half minute spock must not have done very well on the kobiyashimaru test that test is meant to gauge your ability to make good decisions under stress well we should be glad that spock did not have command under combat he could not even withstand somebody making fun of his mother it strange that the spock in the series virtually never loses his cool but when it serves the purposes of the plot kirk is able to get him to lose it instantly ## no one is guarding spock tiny ship in the hangar of nero ship this is just slight error on nero part given that within spock ship is a weapon that can destroy planets you would think nero would post at least a few men there to defend this valuable asset nope i guess his men had better things to do ## there no reason for nero to want to destroy earth his beaf is with spock not anyone on earth ## nero ship is ridiculously powerful does it really makes sense that a mining vessel from the future can take out a starfleet oh yeah one more why does nero hate spock anyway he was trying to save romulus right people need to expect more from movies or we will keep getting crap like this ,3
en,-1498869909,this film was amazing and it was a well written script the movie has emotinal scenes fightng scenes and other tense scenes the fighting at the end was the best tom criuse was amazing and so was the character he was playing overall i give this film ## ## ,9
en,-1498869909,the last samurai is one of the best constructed epics that i have seen and the direction was wonderful first let talk about tom cruise a movie with cruise is an instant box office success but critically cruise tends to overact so how do you combat this carefully prune over the script overacting is ok when cruise is drunk but it is not ok in a touching scene so do not let him speak much cruise does not have to talk much during action so that is good too however people like to see cruise on camera so show a lot of him but use this discretion to keep him from showing off his penchant for overacting and watch the sound because he breathes really loud which can get annoying in this movie the director knew all this and was able to combat the flaws in cruise acting now there were some great actors in this movie like ken watanabe katsumoto who was simply stunning he should be nominated for best supporting actor so good acting is important to this type of film but the two other important aspects are script and action sequences action sequences are very important because this is a samurai movie but the sequences must be tasteful and endearing because there are in the context of the movie watch a van dam movie and its like oh ok time for senseless fighting just like in a porno its like what is your name lets have sex in last samurai the beautifully choreographed action scenes are always meaningful for they are meant to reveal the true essence of characters and in this aspect i do not think i have ever seen a movie in which action so aptly revealed a character the script in an epic is very important because it dictates the pace of a movie if the script is too fast between action scenes then the action scenes lose meaning and the movie becomes another crappy film whose sole purpose is to make a profit i e once upon a time in mexico reindeer gamers any van dam seagal stallone or schwarzenegger movie if the script is too slow you may be watching the english patient or some other god awful overdone movie that is painful to bear because of tediously long periods of complete inaction dialogue and plot is important too because a movie like legends of the fall actually manages to pass the previous test but still finds wanting because of well a corny plot and some stupid dialogue i was cheering with the next guy when aiden quinn shot brad pitt would be killers but it was not a great movie because the plot was way too sweeping the last samurai is not in a rush to finish but never lingers too long on any scene or any subject and this is the movie true accomplishment you feel fulfilled when the movie ends good has not completely triumphed which i am glad for and somehow you feel like a part of you can walk out of the movie a little better whether it be braver or with a greater appreciation for life this being said there are couple of imperfections as there are with any movie # the search for the perfect blossom was a metaphysical search the point was not literally finding one # there a couple too many long looks between cruise and katsumoto s sister # while it treated itself as original the white man always wins although in this case it was pretty clear that had to happen unless you truly cannot stand tom cruise do not hesitate to see this near masterpiece for those of you who hate cruise give it a try because there is a remarkably talented surrounding cast,10
en,520113005,what really struck me in the fisher king were the visuals it was the way in which director terry gilliam managed to give us a picture of parry insanity robin williams was excellent in the part it was a perfect character for him a combination of laughably crazy and tragically insane and he pulled it off brilliantly but it still the imagery that stayed with me the pictures of the red knight that stalked parry in his mind at least and that would not let him go even when he thought he had finally escaped and started to return his life to normal with his budding relationship with lydia amanda plummer those images have a haunting quality to them they do not easily leave you after the movie over after the imagery it the performances that stand out in this as i mentioned robin williams was brilliant as parry and jeff bridges was almost his equal as jack the former radio shock jock whose off the cuff comments led an insane man to shoot up a bar which led to parry wife being killed in front of him and resulted in his insanity obviously parry life is devastated jack life is devastated the story picks up three years later when parry and jack inadvertently meet and jack sees his opportunity for redemption can he help parry get his life back gilliam did a good job directing this it starts out tentatively perhaps a bit slow paced but it builds brilliantly to what i thought was the real climax the return of parry demons after he walks lydia to her apartment and says good bye as he ran screaming through the streets and ended up beaten and bloodied it was one of the most powerful scenes i have seen well done by robin williams for all the strength of the performances by wiliams and bridges it surprising to me that the only acting oscar this won was best supporting actress for mercedes ruehl as jack girlfriend anne williams was nominated for best actor but lost to anthony hopkins for silence of the lambs i cannot argue with the choice of hopkins but williams was superb it may be the best performance i have ever seen from him for me the biggest weakness to this was the ending i would have left it with that climactic scene and cut out much of what came after frankly i was not that taken with the whole holy grail theme and the extended scenes of jack trying to get the grail did not do anything for me i was ready for this to come to a close with that aforementioned scene even if it had meant parry fate being left up in the air i can live with the happy ending but the holy grail material was just distracting still that ending aside i enjoyed this immensely it a very impressive movie # ## ,7
en,1140523496,there are so many things that i like about this movie first of all i do not think there is another movie that has so many great quotes in it not to mention that every character in the movie has their share of great quotes if you are looking for a movie to quote look no further second the dude has the coolest style a guy obviously stuck in the sixties he carelessly and effortlessly slides through life without a job and has the best time at it a kind hearted innocent guy he loves to bowl get high and listen to bob dylan third the plot of this movie is excellent dont be mis led there is very little apparent plot however there is very much going on that is unsaid which makes the movie very complex and intricate to understand the motivations of the individual characters takes some concentration it took me many times of watching it to fully understand what each character had going on in his her head fourth the dialog is highly developed the conversations in this movie are so unlike most movies the characters continuously interrupt each other change subjects lose their train of thought etc such a refreshing departure from the cookie cutter hollywood film but yes there is an unusually high amount of obscenities however this movie does not attempt to sugar coat the vocabulary of real people they keep it true to life as with most of the other coen brothers movies the underlying theme is this something bad or illegal happens and instead of the onlookers trying to help the victims they decide to try to make a personal gain from the situation a masterpiece ## out of ## now go out and watch it ,10
en,1140523496,how could the word genius come to mind when watching this film all you have to do is take a stupid plot and mix it with some dead beat characters that yell a whole lot this movie should not be on the top ### list nor anywhere close you have to think when you finish watching this movie why is this a great film what did i learn from this then you will understand i laughed maybe twice during the whole movie john goodman character lack of not being able to see the scale of problems is not funny at all more irritating than anything else it hard to sit through # hours of listening to him spit out the genius comedy lines that people on here keep raving about these lines are not more that phrases that literally do not make any sense and the only reason people will think they are funny or repeat them because they have no place in any movie for instance what is the bar eats you line now some of you can overanalyze this into making some sense but i am sure that it was written to be just another stupid line that was said with hopes of being overanalyzed into something that made sense do not believe the reviews on this page you really should not waste your time with this one that about all i have to say i feel i have wasted enough time on this movie already by watching it ,5
en,1707142003,i have heard good reviews for this movie so i gave it a try i was very pleased i have never seen a movie starring ryan gosling but he just plays the driver character so well a man of few words but the facial expressions and body language show it all lots of tenderness one moment and then extreme violence which worked quite well the movie may seem slow to start but i was never bored one moment the musical score was incredible a real ## feel i cannot believe the people with negative reviews for drive its a masterpiece in film making and i look forward to seeing many more projects from nicolas winding refn ,10
en,1707142003,if you have seen gosling in fracture excellent it is hard to believe this is the same actor same with christina hendricks of mad men fame glad they played down her huge assets and let us see her act in a different role which is why she probably took the part gosling plays a mcqueen type character in the first part of the movie with subtlety using few words this is much more difficult than most think to do an actor has to really have confidence to pull this off it would be like neil peart playing a solo on a # piece kit one scene that was so simple and pulled me in was spoiler during the pawn shop robbery as the other car pulled into the lot gosling made a fist with his leather glove and the glove tensing into a tight fist was all you heard brilliant bryan cranston was good but i saw a lot of his other characters in this role he always defaults by playing the car salesman or looser guy in debt trying to always make another score the music score was part ## part art fare this was definitely not a hollywood movie reminded me of early cohen bro ,7
en,276766581,there is a touching teen drama with romance some humor and good acting i am not familiar with the novel but as a movie i think it is quite a good story the different themes are quite varied for one movie first love drug use homosexuality sexual abuse and friendship they are not new to movies about teens but the way it put together is fresh realistic and entertaining while avoiding clich s or melodrama logan lerman is well cast as the wallflower charlie who starts high school with some emotional baggage makes new friends and falls in love he is likable enough to be the central character and his crush is quite sweet to watch emma watson acts as the object of his affection sam she brought attention to the movie but i think she is a bit too androgynous and lacking romantic appeal also her diction was too well articulated which made her sound like a fine british actress rather than a troubled pennsylvania girl mae whitman was suitably repulsive as mary elizabeth the unattractive friend nina dobrev as the sister candace did not get enough screen time maybe because she is prettier than the lead emma watson ezra miller as the gay friend is quirky enough while not acting too flamboyant the adults have supporting roles from dylan mcdermott as charlie father and paul rudd as a sympathetic english teacher overall this is a surprisingly moving and well worth a watch ,9

en,977814393,the second part of a trilogy can often be the hardest to get right by this stage you have had your beginning and you know your eventual outcome so the second instalment is merely a task in setting each character up to be in the right place for the third back to the future part # and the empire strikes back are both great examples of films which have this task but do it well enough that the film could be watched as a standalone movie since they are both exciting enough to keep the viewer interested the two towers the second part of the lord of the rings trilogy slightly fails in this respect as it feels very drawn out and uninteresting as if it is just setting up for return of the king luckily the desolation of smaug does not suffer from this at all and is even better than the first part of this trilogy we pick up right where an unexpected journey left off with the group of dwarfs and bilbo martin freeman escaping from the orcs with whom they had fought at the very end over the course of the film the group travel towards and eventually into the lonely mountain where the dragon smaug benedict cumberbatch is sleeping this is no easy journey for them however and on the way they encounter spiders elves which sees a return of orlando bloom legolas and men each of whom is some kind of hindrance to their quest when they eventually reach and enter the mountain they are tasked with trying to steal the arkenstone from smaug which does not quite go as they expected these different encounters usually involve an escape and it is here when the film is most exciting as there is often a lot of chaotic action going on the use of cgi in the film is extremely prominent and works very well in continuing the magical image of middle earth from the first film much like how the greatest part of the first film was bilbo talking to the cgi gollum this film best scene is an exchange between bilbo and smaug martin freeman talent is clearly on show here as he acts masterfully in trying to find and steal the arkenstone without waking the dragon as is slightly traditional with the second parts of trilogies this film is noticeably darker than its predecessor with gandalf storyline at the tombs taking an extremely dark tone the ensemble cast continues to work so well with each other and the group dynamic is one of the things which makes the film more enjoyable as an audience again the film suffers from its own length but not as much as the first film since there are more interesting things going on here and less exposition and while the film ends with an annoying cliffhanger it really the only way it should with everything headed for disaster and the audience wondering how on earth they are going to get out of it it immensely enjoyable and i really cannot wait for the third part ,8
en,977814393,let start bad beginning very bad ending and in the middle nothing to remember this new version of the story of the hobbit unfolds very slowly and boring and the motto there and back again fits perfectly new characters as thranduil or beorn follow the lack of the whole story the action scenes are very confusing and camera shaken all the tests across the journey have the same solution and you could say the same cinematography they all run away making stupid or unknown mistakes how the spiders caught the dwarfs and bilbo saves the day the movie is far from the magic of the classic lotr trilogy and even the first hobbit movie if you would like to see a child action fantasy movie then watch it if not then watch the lotr trilogy again or even better read the books ,3
en,-500916357,this movie is simply one of the best movies let alone war movies of all time but when i watched it i felt anger not anger toward the soldiers or even toward the somali militia but it was directed at those in washington who set ridiculous roes rules of engagement at the beginning of the movie the militia seizes a red cross food shipment and actually guns down dozens of starving refugees trying to get a handful of rice an american blackhawk is hovering right overhead and their request for intervention is denied due to a lack of jurisdiction were we there to help them or not then in the planning of the raid gen garrison request for ac ### gunship support is denied in washington infinite wisdom as it turns out they really could have used it to those critics who say the somali point of view is not brought forth are we talking about the point of view of men who use food and starvation of thousands of people to make a point that point of view is brought out in an interrogation scene between a prominent somali fund raiser and gen garrison and also another interrogation scene between the leader of the militia and wo mike durant or are you talking about the point of view of the somalis cheering on the american soldiers as they finally make it to pakistani stadium and security this movie shows exactly the kinds of efforts that our troops are making right now in the cities and towns of iraq this movie could have just as easily been set in fallujah last november the war is chaotic scary and intense with danger lurking around every street corner only now we are fighting it as an actual war not just trying to arrest certain figures we also have the necessary support and roes from the commanders in theater and back home i want everyone to pay attention to hoot last lines notice how a soldier reacts when he sees a family in a house huddling from the violence outside see what it takes for another soldier who till then had been portrayed as bloodthirsty to shoot a woman these were quick scenes but conveyed the utmost professionalism of our soldiers ,9
en,-500916357,and one that should be shown to every cadet at sandhurst west point hard to know where to begin in praising this excellent film the direction is terrific the action sequences mind blowing the characterisations and acting very good brilliant music the list goes on the gore is graphic yet never gratuitous it is amazingly realistic you really feel that you are in the heat of a genuine battle right down to people being deafened by their own gunfire which always happens in real life but which i have never seen on screen before no other film has ever captured the confusion and chaos of combat the convoy getting lost because of the delay between the helicopters giving the directions and the convoy receiving them was the fatal flaw of the operation the part where the helicopter commander begs the convoy to slow down so he can relay directions correctly whilst colonel mcknight tells them they cannot slow down because they are getting slaughtered is just the sort of thing you would expect in real life and the lesson here keep it simple it a thrill ride yet at the same time it a thoughtful film this is not an exercise in us imperialism the us and un intervention in somalia must rate as one of the most altruistic and unselfish actions of all time with the cold war over somalia was of no strategic importance to anyone and the military intervention purely humanitarian one thing that stands out is that this is perhaps the greatest example of the compromises inherent in film making many of the characters are combined with other real life figures but otherwise you simply would not be able to keep track of who was who it would be a hundred stories in one in real life everyone had shaven heads and wore the same headgear without their names on it but you had to have that for the audience to be able to recognise everyone the film makes pull off the remarkable feat of changing facts to aid the story telling but keeping the integrity of the real events intact favourite scene the bit where ranger jamie smith is badly wounded and the medic tells hq that unless he gets evacuated immediately he going to die and general garrison makes the decision that they have already had # choppers shot down and if they try a rescue they will have a third and more casualties to deal with his decision seals smith fate but you get the idea that it unquestionably the right one so often in films the top brass is portrayed as cold and unfeeling but here you realise why a general earns his pay all told this is the war movie that sets the bar for all others ,10
en,2041022337,titanic is probably the most unlikely successful films of all time it really was no kind of provocative theme at center it was quite simply an epic and an epic love story at that yet this film went on to be the most successful movie of all time both in the box office and the awards seasons the movie does what many people thought would be absolutely impossible it takes you back to the titanic and truly captures exactly what it must have felt like when the unsinkable ship went down through a love story that moves everyone who sees it characters that are diverse and fascinating and probably the best cinematography ever put on screen it makes you feel about this story in a way you have never felt before and that what makes it so amazing it changed the way people looked at this story forever it made them truly understand the tragedy of what happened that night the acting is fantastic leonardo dicaprio does a fine job and was very under appreciated for this performance however the reason for that is because no one could take their eyes off of kate winslet this movie made her what she is today her performance is still fantastic as you watch it even now the movie was hers from the moment she came on screen it true that it is at heart a love story but it not only about the two central characters of jack and rose to me the real love story is about the titanic itself before i saw this movie it was an interesting story and that was all because of this movie and the vividness it portrayed it is a story i will never forget it become a story that will never die in the hearts of people and the movie is what truly did that it changed the way that people thought of titanic forever i think bill paxton character said it best right at the end all my life i have thought of nothing but titanic but i never really got it until now i understand mr paxton i feel the same way an absolutely fantastic film and probably one of the best ever made # ## stars jay addison,9
en,2041022337,you know why leonardo dicaprio was not nominated for an oscar for his role in the movie simple his acting was not very good and at times it was the equivalent of some of the performances one might see on an after school special that will keep this film from holding the title greatest of all time i still say that titanic was not even the best movie of #### that should have gone to la confidential but that argument is for another time ,9
en,2041022337,a poor young man named jack dawson leonardo dicaprio and a rich girl named rose dewitt bukator kate winslet fall in love on the titanic the unsinkable ship but rose has a decision to make because she is actually on her way to marrying another man cal hockley who was jack locked up in a room when the so called unsinkable ship hits an iceberg and begins to sink rose now must find jack before the ship sinks and they drown and they must fight to stay alive on the sinking titanic one of the most impressive parts of this film was the fantastic visuals they were absolutely stunning and they really needed to be for the film to work the story was obviously very sad and probably most people before they even see the film can guess how it will end the story to the titanic in general is just one of the most tragic events in history and james cameron did a very good job making it into a movie the direction was actually what i thought to maybe be the best part of the film it took a lot of skill on the part of james cameron to make such a realistic yet good movie to make a tragic true story such as this the cast is really a very important part of the film it could possibly either ruin or make a movie obviously in the case of pearl harbor many believe the cast could have very nearly destroyed the movie thank you michael bay however the titanic i found the cast to be perfect leonardo dicaprio may not have been even so much as nominated for an oscar which if you look at who was nominated he probably did not deserve to be but his performance was still nothing short of excellent kate winslet though was easily deserving of her nomination her performance was brilliant the musical score by james horner was incredible he will always be remembered by me for the music to this film and a beautiful mind overall the titanic really was a great film with outstanding visuals beautiful acting and unbelievable direction i think a lot of people think this film is overrated and i do understand where they are coming from because ## ## oscars might be taking it a bit too far but the film really was good and it deserved many of the oscars that it won titanic is one of the better movies that i have seen and will always be considered so by me ,9
en,2041022337, titanic was the biggest ship of its time no ship could stand up against her grandeur and excellence she was in every word a true master piece but after her maiden voyage ended in tragedy she was long lost in the deepest depths of the mighty atlantic until she was once again found out in #### but the world had to wait # more years for her story to be heard but mankind had to wait ## years for her greatest story to be heard the story of the most beautiful love story one ears could hear james cameron produced his masterpiece on celluloid with titanic the movie captures each and every one who sets eyes on the screen with its element of humanity and love titanic is not the story of the biggest ship its the story of two people separated by the tumults and classes of society but blend into one soul with their love this is truly one of the finest movies made a true masterpiece a must see be amazed at the beauty of love courage and the stark realities of the humanity and the one thing which wins over any barrier love ,10
en,2041022337,titanic directed by james cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the titanic the plot is simple noncomplicated or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense the end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film but the love story is an interesting one however kate winslett is wonderful as rose an aristocratic young lady betrothed by cal billy zane early on the voyage rose meets jack leonardo dicaprio a lower class artist on his way to america after winning his ticket aboard titanic in a poker game if he wants something he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries the two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the titanic primarily through their eyes the movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures that sunk with the titanic which has recently occurred one of the survivors of the titanic rose dewitt bukater who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search she gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the titanic with this the scene shifts to southhampton ireland where the titanic set sail from on april ## #### as all the passengers are boarding after another stop on the irish coast titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the atlantic bound for new york historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy cal hockley and falls in love with third class passenger jack dawson captain smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the white star line director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in new york on thursday night and not on friday morning as planned smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirty two years of experience to stretch the titanic legs out to full speed the titanic had reports that the waters in the atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie on april ## #### at ## ## an iceberg was sighted they attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film the portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate the crew of titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until # ## when the lights finally failed the lights of the california were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to titanic many pleas for help the california had tried earlier in the day to warn titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but titanic had brushed them off causing the california to turn off its radio and leave the titanic on its own the first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too the word of white star line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking also the metal that was used to build the titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold which were experienced the night titanic sank to be extremely brittle overall the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the titanic many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship the core group of rose jack cal and rose mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time yet many characters such as the unsinkable molly brown captain edward smith the ship designer thomas andrew the white star line representative bruce ismay and all of the titanic officers were real the maiden voyage was going to be captain edward smith last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards he had been a part of the white star line since #### where he worked his way up to his status as the millionaire captain when the titanic sunk the portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol he is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that james cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officer former canadian hometown as shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lower class passengers from non english speaking nations in addition officer lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted the old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the strauss not wanting to leave her husband side mrs strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the titanic furthermore mr goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best the richest man on the ship john jacob astor who owned most of manhattan died nonetheless as well but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat in addition molly brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the carpethia that picked the survivors of titanic up from the water her ticket on the titanic had cost over four thousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke all of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware the gymnasium which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs the wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent re creation of the post victorian era of #### the rich at this time practically ruled everything as the women suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet women during this time often married for financial security as rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as cal wished for rose to do the rich did not take well to new money such as molly brown as depicted everything of the time was very formal women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with rose in the movie men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society although james cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of titanic coupled with two years spent cross referencing the history of the titanic and few liberties were taken the beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking a recognizable message can be seen in the movie titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise the director james cameron shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in people lives everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the titanic on that fateful night in addition this film is a reflection of the #### when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the titanic only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual titanic been found and explored this movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed however the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed there have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in titanic but all have failed as it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter technically the film is very well done to get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie in addition a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside titanic as anyone has in the ## years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship furthermore throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of titanic to the scene of titanic during its actual voyage this shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner at the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the european coast on titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art a true epic like most history novels we know the ending but it does not take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture certain aspects of this film are academy award material including costuming sound cintematography and editing if you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early #### and how they face disaster then this movie definitely is for you ,10
en,2041022337,i could not believe how hilarious this film was cannot speak for my husband as he fell asleep in the cinema this film was so comical that it actually made me laugh outloud in the cinema something that does not happen that often when i was not laughing i was sat with my mouth open incredulous how on earth did james cameron come up with such funny dialogue maybe he been watching too much monty python on second thoughts the monty python team could have probably done this film much more justice although how the love scenes could be made more farcical i cannot imagine whenever i am feeling down i am going to put this film and i am sure it will do a great job of lifting my spirits i have just had another thought did any of the actors realise this was a comedy because their flair for humour and satire was so natural it amazed me please please can we have a sequel preferably with leslie nielson or someone serious like him starring ,10

en,-1557021310,greetings again from the darkness what usually sets apart a great mystery thriller from an average one is the story in part one of the millennium trilogy based on stieg larsson books the story is really good but the point of difference comes in the titular performance of noomi rapace as lisbeth american audiences are rarely treated to this type of raw gritty performance from an actress she alone makes the film worth seeing please do not get me wrong i really like the film a murder mystery who dunnit that on the surface appears like an agathy christie story it quickly proves to us how looks can be deceiving both in story line and in characters though the story wraps up a bit too neatly the long winding road over a fortuitous bridge gives us a wild ride of hints suspects and research that is a blast for those who enjoy such things michael nyqvist stars as mikael blomkvist an investigative writer who gets set up on charges of libel against a powerful businessman while awaiting his jail time blomkvist is hired by an ## year old uncle of a girl gone missing some ## years ago oh yes she is part of the vanger family who live on a private island and who have multiple members with a history of nazi loyalties as blomkvist investigates the ancient mystery it turns out he is being followed via super hacker lisbeth after a few twists these two turn into a highly unlikely but very interesting and effective mystery solving couple besides the performance of rapace what really sets this one apart is that the villains really are not the most interesting characters blomkvist and lisbeth are we are treated to a great deal of character development for both and trust me when i say lisbeth story is not pleasant i hear this will be americanized in the remake and that makes me sad the edgy undercurrent of sex abuse politics and religious racism will undoubtedly be softened and surely the lead actress will bring little of the fascination that noomi rapace delivers ,8

en,-175422583,i have seen this movie twice and i enjoyed it as much the second time as i did the first time of course the surprise effect is gone the second time because you know how the story goes but that is not a problem the story is brilliant it amazing how clever andy is the acting is outstanding morgan freeman proves again he is a top talent and also tim robbins is wonderful the story has everything it very sensitive and it shows some aspects of prison that are not shown in other prison movies it think but i am not sure because i have never been in prison it gives a unique but realistic view on the prison life and the many feelings prisoners are confronted with doing their time the example of very tragic but so true i think the guy has been his whole life in prison that the only life he knows and when he is released he does not know how to built up a life in the real world because the world he know before prison does not exist anymore frank darabont proves he is a remarkable director and that he is made for directing prison movies the green mile is also an excellent and touching prison drama it almost unbelievable that the shawshank redemption did not won any academy award but of course you cannot deny that fact that the competition was fierce that year with also forrest gump in the running highly recommendable prison drama with great acting performances by morgan freeman and tim robbins # ##,9

en,-175422583,before i saw this movie it was hard for me to imagine why so many people liked it i figured it must be one of those gritty movies that people like because of its harsh realism but in truth it is so much more than that in fact i do not find it very gritty at all i can now understand why it is the second highest movie on imdb top ### and why so many of my friends list it as their favorite movie it is the most emotionally powerful movie i have ever seen and i doubt anything i see will top it tim robbins plays andy dufresne a man convicted of killing his wife and her lover morgan freeman plays the convicted killer ellis redding that befriends andy in prison these are two very touching and true performances tim robbins should have at least been nominated for an oscar for the quiet intensity he brought to his role he takes on the right sense of mystery required for the role and he gives the movie the conviction it needs to reach its emotional heights marlon brando claimed that some roles are actor proof the story is so good that no actor can mess it up this could possibly be one of those roles but i cannot help feeling that a lesser actor would have overacted and destroyed robbins character morgan freeman was nominated and justly so though it is an injustice that he was chosen above robbins they both are equals in this movie he complements robbins beautifully as a stoic man that understands prison life better than anyone else he also narrates the movie we see things through his eyes and experience things through his words as in million dollar baby his voice provides the movie with its thematic focus the supporting cast is fine but james whitmore stands out as the prison librarian the actors do not make this a great movie though they were given a great story and they lived it for us perfectly but it is the story that lives on after the movie is over stephen king may be a pop fiction author but he has an extraordinary grasp on human nature which is brought to light in shawshank marlon brando also said that movies are good because of what we bring to them and i suppose there some truth in that though there are some movies that are good no matter what casablanca and citizen kane for example i do not know which category this movie belongs to and i am afraid that because i love it so much i do not trust myself to say i can say however that everyone can identify with the triumph of the human spirit and maybe that explains why it is such a beloved movie it really is a shame that the shawshank redemption came out in #### the same year as forrest gump and pulp fiction all three are great movies and all three deserved best picture but to me shawshank is the best of them all and will continue to resonate with me for a long time to come ,10

en,-38763628,no movie has ever wow ed me more than p t anderson magnolia it runs long at over # hours but i see no way around it ending this movie any second early would take away the superb acting perfect plot structure and incredible film technique i would say that this movie has one of if not the best ensemble cast ever i could not believe that the critics had to decide who should get nominated for best supporting actor they all deserved it though in my mind philip baker hall should have won overall the film is complicated we not only have the theme set up at the beginning about strange coincidences but the relationship between the parallels between sets of characters in the movie are fascinating we notice the almost identical struggles of characters like stanley and frank jimmy and earl stanley and donny claudia and linda jim and frank the list goes on and the relationships overlap as if these struggles are not obvious enough by the story line p t anderson spells them out for us in soliloquoys seemingly random quotes by the characters and through music there is absolutely no way that one could find this movie confusing when everything is presented for you on the screen in such a neat little package i have heard complaints about the frogs but i honestly see no way the movie could have gotten around them this instance ties the story together gives meaning to the characters lives and is one of the most daring and brilliant scenes i have ever seen if i were to give this film a rating it would be two thumbs up # stars ## out of ## etc i definitely see how it is ranked so high on the top ### list and if it were my list it would make the top ten if you want an exciting action packed movie and have a short attention span see trashy movies like fast and the furious or rollerball or a steven spielberg picture if you want to see a beautifully crafted acted film that is almost guaranteed to change your movie going experience for the rest of your life see magnolia ,5
en,-1549758569,i was already a fan of both de niro and walken when i first saw this movie and it blew me away the wedding sequence is a bit overdone but at least it allowed for some character development the russian roulette sequences had me on the edge of my seat and de niro savage walken streep and cazale were all fantastic i just found out that john cazale died right after this movie was made that guy had a short resume but it sure was impressive ## ## as far as vietnam movies go this is second only to apocalypse now ,10
en,-1549758569,this film is the most emotionally challenging film i have ever watched christopher walken plays the role of a lifetime and de niro streep are perfect for their roles as well this is the only movie in which after viewing it i was so shocked disturbed depressed that i did not want to move all i could do was think about the movie for an hour afterward the only movie that even comes close to affecting you as much as this film is requiem for a dream if you have not seen the deer hunter do yourself a favor and go see it it guaranteed to be one of if not the most memorable film you will ever see the only reason i gave this a # ## is because there are some pretty glaring flaws with the realism of the war scenes but they are so minor to the overall effect of the film that they do not really matter ,10
en,-1549758569,steve nick and mike all had very different varying personalities that most would think to clash but actually their unique personalities helped pull and keep them together mike was the leader he was strong and forceful with a bad temper but he knew how to keep his cool which helps out in sticky situations mike is the foundation of the group everyone depends on him for advice help and boots nicky was the easygoing reasonable friend who seemed to get along with anyone i think nicky tried to be strong like mike but he just was not as emotionally stable steve was sort of the baby of the group everyone took care of him and made sure he was okay mike was clearly made for the army he was not only brawny but he had a hard mind set he knew what he needed to do and how to do it for example when he nicky and steve are trapped in the pow camp he plans on the go to escape with his fellow comrades nicky and steve could not deal with war it was more psychological and emotional than physical for them steve needy personality caused him to not be able to go on without support of the others steve ends up losing his legs and being transplanted in a veteran hospital nicky personality allows him to live on his own just not in a physical safe way he was very malleable he could become what other people wanted by the end of the film he is a mindless zombie only living because he could not die all three of their personalities foreshadowed how they would act in the war but i was surprised that nicky died i thought that it would have been steve who died because he seemed to have a weaker mind set this could have happened differently i do not think mike would have died because he could not he was too much of a leader and it would have ruined the film if he had died nicky was my favourite character so when he died it made me sad i think that steve should have died not because he was not a likable character but because he was so much weaker than everyone else in the film overall i liked the ending and series of events because it still portrays steve depending on others and mike being the leader it was continuous in following their personalities ,6
en,-1549758569,rather than focusing the entire film on the vietnam war michael cimino chose to emphasize character evolution and the aftermath of war on a small blue collar pennsylvania town this not only removes the deer hunter from the war movie category but makes it so much more while the first third of the film is long and parts can be cut say what you will but the marriage scene could have been slimmed down and the scene when the guys kept on driving off without john george dzundza was almost unnecessary this is an excellent film that continues to shine more than twenty five years later the talent in this film is immeasurable with an all star cast including robert deniro meryl streep christopher walken and john cazale while everyone at home goes about their everyday lives michael robert deniro nick christopher walken and steven john savage go through a war that shatters their enthusiasm the war continues to ravage their lives even after they are done fighting michael can no longer hunt nick mind is broken as he sits playing russian roulette in saigon and steven is paralyzed meryl streep deserves accolades for this film as well as she plays the woman torn between michael and nick her character demonstrates war power in affecting those who stayed at home unlike so many films that romanticize wars as honorable and good vs evil the deer hunter shows that war is a hell that follows you home the last scene in saigon will catch you by surprise every time you watch it ,7
en,2085292952, edge of tomorrow #### directed by doug liman is a military science fiction film that revolves around cruise character endlessly repeating the same day always dying to explore his evolution from coward to hero by deftly showing cruise changing responses to the same people and events in the run up to landing in the battle zone he undergoes a subtle metamorphosis from attempting blackmail on general brigham brendan gleeson in order to avoid action to eventually realising he alone can combat the alien threat it a well written character arc he is allowed to handle a complex role which can switch deftly from seriousness to black humour stemming from him being able to predict what other characters are about to say and do due to his multitude of deaths it his best performance in a long time benefiting from the intelligence of the material he has to work with it also a testament to the script that the time loop never becomes tiresome but instead is constantly inventive in its repetition the storytelling enlivened by the elliptical editing of james herbert and laura jennings scripted by christopher mcquarrie jez and john henry butterworth based on the japanese novel all you need is kill by hiroshi sakurazaka they handle the variety of plot threads and main duplication of the same day very well emily blunt playing a renowned warrior has the more limited role her character are set every time cruise dies but nevertheless shows her ability to project external strength and an admirable lack of sentiment in her training of cruise bill paxton as a tough sergeant major is fairly one note but it a fun note all the same paxton clearly enjoying himself in his constant admonishing of cruise director liman is able to deal with kinetic action scenes as well as quieter character orientated moments whilst cleverly altering how he films repeating sequences the main battle scene on the french beach is a good example initially staying with cruise point of view but gradually revealing more information each time until around midway through liman pulls his camera back and reveals in a long shot the enormity of the military operation visually he and his cinematographer dion beebe are aided by the interesting production design in particular the exoskeletons the soldiers wear and the design of the aliens themselves which creates a neat dichotomy with the contemporary appearance of much of this near future world if its final act is slightly weaker preventing it from becoming truly excellent this is certainly a far sharper original and more intriguing sci fi action film than is normally found ,8
en,2085292952,this movie was so funny so exciting and extremely unexpected i have surprised by the amazing humorous in it and also the ending has been totally unexpected no one can say a word about tom cruise in action movies i mean this is his job and his field this is what he always do and off course he is extraordinary and amazing in doing it talking about action although this is her first action emily blunt was really awesome she did it like she has been doing this all over her life there were also has a great vfx in this movie and the actors interacted with them so well i had a great time seeing the movie and for sure i would see it over and over again ,10

en,-656783461,philadelphia is a film that was one of the first mainstream hollywood films to acknowledge hiv aids homosexuality and homophobia it stars tom hanks and denzel washington together with jason robards mary steenburgen antonio banderas joanne woodward and stephanie roth it was inspired in part by the story of geoffrey bowers an attorney who in #### sued the law firm baker mckenzie for wrongful dismissal in one of the first aids discrimination cases it was written by ron nyswaner and directed by jonathan demme at the time of its release philadelphia was the first big budget film to tackle the medical political and social issues of aids andrew beckett is a talented lawyer at a stodgy philadelphia law firm the homosexual andrew has contracted aids but fears informing his firm about the disease the firm senior partner charles wheeler assigns andrew a case involving their most important client andrew begins diligently working on the case but soon the lesions associated with aids are visible on his face wheeler abruptly removes andrew from the case and fires him from the firm andrew believes he has been fired because of his illness and plans to fight the firm in court but because of the firm reputation no lawyer in philadelphia will risk handling his case in desperation andrew hires joe miller a black lawyer who advertises on television mainly handling personal injury cases miller dislikes homosexuals but agrees to take the case for the money and exposure as miller prepares for the courtroom battle against one of the law firm key litigators belinda conine miller begins to realize the discrimination practiced against andrew is no different from the discrimination miller himself has to battle against during cross examination beckett admits that he was originally planning to tell his law colleagues that he was gay but changed his mind after hearing them make homophobic jokes in the sauna of a health club when asked about the truth of how he got infected he confirms that he engaged in anonymous sex with another man at a pornographic movie theater however he and miller gain an advantage when the partner who advised settling out of court confesses he long suspected beckett had aids but never said anything and how he regrets his inaction it is an extremely well made message picture about tolerance justice and discrimination is pitched at mainstream audiences it is not just canny corny and blatantly patriotic but compassionate compelling and emotionally devastating it was a moving film that fostered empathy towards homosexuals and people with aids the cast was exceptionally brilliant especially tom hanks who obviously deserved his oscar win for the portrayal of andrew beckett obviously the film tried its best to be both apolitical and non preachy despite the fact that it has a message to impose to its viewers an added amount of humor was perfectly blended as well this is a must see picture not only for a masterpiece hanks washington collaboration but also for it was a landmark film towards asking for tolerance towards homosexuals and people who have contracted aids ,10
en,1184626589,when the matrix was first released in #### i thought oh another sci fi spin off and generally rejected it as not my sort of film boy how wrong was i i first borrowed it from someone and when i watched it i thought oh my god i have missed so much i was totally blown away by it from trinity slow mo kick to neo bullet dodging i was exhilarated not because of the film plot even though the plot is very good but because i realised where all the slo mo and bullet time especially from max payne came from the most interesting character and i am sure most people will agree with me is agent smith he is so very suave and cool do not you just love that black suit and tie the gunplay and special effects are also breathtakingly realistic even the bullets have tremendous detail as they disturb the air overall the matrix is a great movie and remains one of my best also check out my comments on the other two films ,9
en,1184626589,wow this film blew me away when i first saw it back in #### the sound track is fantastic yes i have watched the film lots lots though no one bought me it on video anyway back to the most fantastic film i have seen ever i just could not get my head back to reality it was as best described as a what if that is the truth i mean this film tests your brain you enjoy it it gives you that buzzing sensation of what if either that or the sound at the cinema was way too loud i do not know where there going with the second film but with a cast a director a producer like that i have seen some of their other work it really good but the matrix takes the biscuit it just the best m ,9
en,1184626589,the matrix is a good entertaining movie spectacular visual effects and amazing sound it would be easy to write this movie off if it did not essentially deliver what it was made to do entertain i do not know if the wachowski brothers were trying to include a deeper almost philosophical meaning to the movie but i did not watch it for that i watched it to be entertained there are movies that can be entertaining and deliver a powerful message at the same time i think this one failed in the latter the matrix is i will say again good entertainment it deserved its academy awards by all means but for it to be in the top ## greatest imdb movies is outrageous maybe this movie will be the foundation for all science fiction movies to come within the next ## years we have already seen evidence of that what if there were no special effects the famous sci fi films like star wars and e t would not be as outstanding without the special effects but there would still be a good movie there now the matrix take away the visual effects what do you have basically a poor screenplay and some lousy actors ,10
en,1184626589,the immagination the ingenuity that took the brother to write and direct such an extraordinary movie makes me happy i was born in this era so i could see it the matrix is simply the best movie of all the cast and crew of the movie is magnificent i am glad to see a movie that does not take the audience as an object that can not think for them selfs the matrix makes you think make go home and simply think of all the possibility of what is this that we call living the best movie i have ever seen ,10

en,1184626589,every year there seems to be at least one movie that has theater goers buzzing but which ends up being much ado about nothing here #### the matrix whether it the hokey idea of robots using humans as batteries rather than harvesting power chemically or geochemically the dissolution of the trying to be hip science fiction movie plot into a typical action shoot em up vehicle or the bedamned hollywood ending there much to annoy the serious film viewer in the matrix its basic plot human discovers he in a faked alien generated reality discovers he has super powers to fight aliens was used in #### dark city a more stylish film that also suffers from a hollywood esque ending invest your # # or # in duracell stock ,4
en,1184626589,the matrix was a decent piece of modern dystopian science fiction but it is very much over rated the main theme of the film seems to be on the dangers of technology this is an important theme but it is done much better in the terminator series and the lord of the rings series the special effects were impressive but the film did not deserve the # oscars that it won #### the phantom menace was superior both technically and in terms of story telling the overall feel of the matrix is very dark and dirty with very little light an ok movie overall # ##,7
en,-1664490593,the more i watch ray it plays a lot on the hbo channels on tv the more i get the sense that the film could have been better than what was deserved taylor hackford direction is slick at times and has a decent hand held quality but at times its all for things all too typical in a musician life ala biography movie hackford puts through a non linear structure in the story but it does not really work to make a real dramatic advantage hackford puts in scenes from ray charles childhood into moments that pump up the melodrama if that the right word into being too manipulative for its own good there are also elements in charles childhood that could have been used better for the sake of the story to help make it clearer about what drove charles to his demons #### film walk the line not to make too close a comparison dealt with the subject matter straight on the film ray juggles with its subjects over the course of #### to the late #### with almost too much to show and in a way the film is watchable despite its flaws in the structure and repetitiveness for a good chunk of the film its really just ray takes junk ray cheats on his wife ray makes hits ray takes junk ray has a flashback etc ray charles music is remarkable inspiring and stands against music of today as being almost good for the soul even as early on it was called would evil music i e combining blues and gospel which took some getting used to for people in the ## there rarely a song of his at least shown in the film that is not worth listening to as it crosses racial divides and there a mention of that in the film nothing too big bringing the power and soul of his music for everyone and not just his r b stuff but even his more country type music at the least the musical performance scenes are worth checking out the movie alone there also a certain complexity or lack thereof in jamie foxx portrayal the problem also lies on the bordering of just an imitation of charles versus a performance sometimes foxx channels in and just does a good acting job but there are perhaps too many moments and scenes where its too much bordering on parody i do not meant to downplay it too much he does do what he can with the material and apparently prepared extensively for his role by being around charles and playing the piano for real there is talent in his work in the film but it sometimes cannot over come the direction or script for example the last twenty minutes or so of the film are a mess a trippy kind of sequence showing charles kicking junk followed by a symbolic forgiving of charles with his mother this is just poor film making to me as a filmmaker running out of a better way to make a catharsis that the film has to stop at the point it does does not leave much room for other options i do not deny there is potential in the film that the music alone makes it worth seeing at least one if your already a fan for sure but even if not the music may turn you on to some of his lesser heard recordings and that there are some impressive acting scenes regina king is terrific in her scenes for example but there is too much left unexplained and not for the good of ambiguity sake and over length tends to creep in on it too it the kind of film i end up watching anyway now on tv as its an easy film to watch however not with the sort of complexity that could have been put into the story ,6
en,1134267303,this is the kind of film that lets you know right from the beginning that you are in for the ride of your life from beginning to end the story that they tell are powerful involving and yes extremely violent one thing that i found intriguing was the structure of the story it was reminiscent of pulp fiction in this manner you get introduced to one character and you see his story unfold then the next then the next but what is really great is how they brought other character into the other persons story during micky rourks bit you get a glimpse of clive owen and then after mickey rourk is finished they tell you why clive was there in the end everything comes together in a very interesting way as for cinematography i have this to say i am a film student right now the second i go pro i am using hd and only hd because if that the kind of look you can get out of it there is no reason to spend the extra money on the ## mm film camera for what they were trying to do with this film high definition was the only way to go they made ever element of sin city including the actors look smooth and the composition of the shadows was absolutely amazing the acting in and of itself would usually not impress anyone if it was not for the overall feel of the film really what you got were performances reminiscent of the ####s noir films like double indemnity or the maltese falcon of coarse these are very different stories but they still bare some basic similarities that made performances like this motivated and even more powerful than they would have been had the simply gone with what we consider now to be proper acting style i am usually a big opponent of the use of voice over but it was used perfectly in this movie it was needed and it was completely motivated of coarse voice over is a common element in the noir genre and that still holds true for neo noir films such as this it opens a window to there innermost thoughts and allows us to see a full human even if we only get to follow his story for a little while it also worked simply because of the phenomenal writing it was witty it was intelligent it was funny and it was at the same time serious really top notch writing this is a film that you will never forget and i guarantee you i will see it a couple more times before it hits dvd the bottom line is to miss sin city while it is in theater is to simply let cinematic history pass you by ,8
en,1134267303,i just returned from the march ## #### press screening of sin city shown at the awesome senator theater in baltimore md sin city will go down as the blade runner of comic book films the film had an amazing feel to it and combined many visual styles to create a new filmic language all the elements of a film noir action film were present dimly lit scenes monotone voice over narrative and exquisitely placed one liners i am not very familiar with comic book art but the film used a bunch of familiar elements bad guys eyes were masked behind opaque glasses lenses and the scenes with characters driving looked like the comic cell where the car is speeding off into the distance limited splashes of color are used to accentuate key parts of the film or characters that will drive the rest of the story the film is like nothing that has come before it and i am sure many will try to follow its lead the acting is great with no single character stealing the show the makeup is amazing and even though the actors are often performing superhuman feats the scenes do not poses any of the silliness of a film like the hulk everything on the screen is believable because it is taking place in a comic book setting where anything is possible rodriguez crafts a world never before seen on film he polishes it all off with a soundtrack is not at all intrusive and helps build the mood of the film rodriguez stays true to his art form and except for a massive continuity flaw with blood on mickey rourke chin and mouth appearing and disappearing he keeps the film moving along seamlessly elements of past films have been placed through out the film one pivotal scene begins at a loading dock that looks exactly like the one in the matrix just before cipher drops the cell phone in the trashcan the wrap around storyline echoes pulp fiction beautifully rutger hauer scene looks like it could have come off the cutting room floor of blade runner rodriguez pays homage to those that came before him and provides us with numerous familiar visual elements sin city will probably flop in theaters just because everything edgy and new generally does dennis miller once appeared on the ben stiller show and said i love your show you are doing cutting edge stuff how long until it gets canceled like mine did sin city will have a massive cult following and influence many future films years from now it will get the recognition that its due rodriguez stays true to his beliefs and even resigned from the director guild of america to make sure frank miller just credit as co director there should be more people like him in hollywood sin city is far better than any spider man or daredevil junk that has been produced in the past who knows maybe people will even go rent roadracers to see where that rodriguez guy was coming from early in his career catch sin city in the theater as soon as possible you wo not be disappointed,1

en,1134267303,sin city is an interesting movie to watch because of it visual style it appears as if cinema has been brought to a comic book rather than the other way around however as with so many other recent movies just because it different and unlike anything that been done before that does not automatically mean it a good movie the film revolves around # stories that have only a very loose connection to each other about ## of the characters in the film are confined to their story each story is mildly interesting and some entertaining stuff happens but there is not enough time or enough of a backstory to get involved in the characters lives and care about what is happening some performances are good some are not the movie desperately wants to channel the same vibe as kill bill volume # a film that celebrated spewing blood with such a brilliant comedic flare sin city wants to have that same energy and charisma but fails this film is violent and borderline hard to watch the movie is visually stunning to look at and i imagine it looked fantastic on the big screen however as was the case with pulp fiction being john malkovich and memento different does not automatically mean good ,5
en,1134267303,cinematography perfect acting perfect casting perfect music perfect storyline perfect direction perfect one of the best movies i have seen in years it very violent but that seems to only make it better it stylized almost like a film noir only one that was directed by tarantino i would recommend this movie to anyone who can stomach some gore because if you can get past that you are in for an amazing story films like this break the barriers and set a new expectation for what a good film really is i cannot think of a single thing i would change in this movie to make it any better ,9

en,-1004986445,this is a great film i loved it the first time i saw it on television and have both region # copies of the dvd releases i watched this film again at the weekend for the first time in ages and i had forgotten how good it actually is it has a great story a heist gone wrong told in a non linear fashion it has a great cast including three outstanding performances in my opinion keitel madsen roth and a memorable script with countless quotable scenes everything about this film is interesting the conversation in the coffee shop where we are introduced to all the characters and are given a little insight to them this scene is funny but does not prepare us for the mayhem to proceed after the title credits we meet tow of the characters in a getaway car one covered in blood not sure he is gonna live and the other one panicking and trying to clam him down while driving away we then reach the warehouse where we remain for the majority of the film and find put more about the characters and the robbery gone wrong i wish i knew more about cinematography and the like to really appreciate films but always listen to commentary and watch the documentaries on dvds to get a greater insight into that kinda thing however the camera work in this film is really interesting and you can tell every shot had a lot of planning behind it i think quentin tarantino is great and i have throughly enjoyed all of his films and scripts i have seen tr nbk rd pf jb kbv# # and think its great that he uses similar things in his films big kahuna burgers red apple cigs and characters are referenced alabama and marsellus are both mentioned by joe in rd i know this is not very coherent or in depth this is my first review of a film but i think it that good that i felt compelled to do so i am only an amateur film ,9
en,-1004986445,earth shattering debut for writer director quentin tarantino as he weaves a wicked and demented tale of five strangers harvey keitel tim roth steve buscemi michael madsen and tarantino himself who are recruited by a mastermind lawrence tierney and his son chris penn to pull off a daring diamond heist in los angeles the five have never worked together and really know nothing about each other when the heist turns into a fire fight with cops out on the streets of downtown l a it becomes obvious that someone is really an undercover cop but which one tarantino knew way back in #### how to eliminate the bindings of straight story telling and time elements as he uses flashbacks and sequence less methods to get his points across reservoir dogs is a really great achievement for the genre because it was trail blazing and unique for its era and it stands the test of time very well tarantino would use this feature as a jump board to do even better work pulp fiction and jackie brown love him or hate him tarantino is a highly gifted writer and director that knows exactly what he is doing a stunning and thunderous achievement # # out of # stars ,9

en,-1004986445,it also has no entertainment value it was a chore to watch it all about stupid people killing each other the senseless violence is extremely offensive and although i could see the language being typical of the type of person i found that offensive too i could have spent my time better lying on my bed watching the ceiling for ## minutes ,4
en,-1004986445,i am a huge tarantino fan pulp fiction and the kill bills are easily in my top ## all time this movie sucked the story is boring the script lacks wit the acting was subpar for the caliber of actors they rounded up it is not an emotional crime drama it is not an exciting action movie it definitely is not a funny cool dark comedy i do not know what it is but it is not as cool as it should be give quinton a pass as he was basically a first time director and enjoy his later work over and over again but do not watch this one it wo not meet any expectations you have coming into it ,1
en,1234770868,it truly a beautiful movie for all ages i just love how you relate so much with the characters i have never in a animated movie felt so close with the characters the details on their expressions are simply poetic i love the story the effects are perfect woody is perfect the ken jokes are brilliant everything that happens with buzz the villain and his story which was a whole other brilliant movie on it own man everything is just perfect for this movie i got to say pixar did it this time if you are a sensible person i assure you that you will cry i am kind of hard for that but it did get me all emotional specially the part they are all going to i went to the movie thinking it would be great but it was more than that it truly a animated masterpiece,9
en,1234770868,there a law in moiveology much like isaac newton laws of motion well call this the law of sequels it is stated as a franchise accumulates sequels the value of each successive film approaches crap however as in all fields of science when a movie arises that contradicts our laws and theories no matter how well founded they may appear to be we must revise our old ways of thinking in exchange for the new this is one of those times go see toy story # toy story # contains some of the most powerful and emotionally resonate scenes of the toy story franchise yet is also so funny that you may need to bring an extra pair of pants and not just for the little ones it has its flaws although they detract little from the film this rare sequel ties in so organically with the first two films that you would be amazed to realize that the toy story franchise was never intended to be a trilogy ,10
en,1234770868,i have had a streak with mediocre and fairly entertaining movies this summer and thankfully toy story # ended it this movie had the laughs the thrills and at the end of it all you will be struggling to keep yourself from shedding tears i do not care if i make it sound overrated or hyped up but what i saw was what i saw a sequel that lives up to the franchise and so much more the voice acting is lively and even for a sequel that is darker compared to its predecessors the vibrant new characters fill up the screen wonderfully no longer did i think about tom hanks and tim allen and co i was seeing woody and buzz and the gang playing out their parts they all do a great job bringing our beloved friends to life i have to be honest i did not get teary eyed by the movie end but my heart just melted with the emotions it is a worthy conclusion to my childhood favorite an early but very strong contender for the best animated feature and if things go the way we fans want it best picture oscar simply one of the best movies of this year ,10
en,1234770868,as a fan of animated movies such as the shrek series toy story all the pixar greats and madagascar i was excited to go see toy story the movie started of typical as you got to see all the classic toys as the entered the first scene woody buzz mr potato head etc then andy was introduced there to his mother telling him he has to put his toys in the attic throw them away or take them with him to college after this point the whole movie goes downhill every single thing is predictable from a to z you know the toys are going to get donate as soon as you meet the bear you know he is evil plus his back story was boring you know woody is going to break out come back save the toys i could have written the whole script in five minutes and the story has been done again and again plus there was probably a handful of good jokes ## year waste for this forty minutes into the movie i wanted to leave and if i was not with my girlfriend i would have left the story needed a bigger connection with people as the first two movies had to do with the toys and there interaction with humans while this movie was all about toys being held captive by other toys i thought that was a mistake as one can not relate the bottom line do not see unless you want to waste your money on a predictable unentertaining movie sit home watch the original or rent shrek two this movie only disappoints ,2
en,1234770869,this rare sequel is a great movie unto itself that is so uncommon with sequels it should get an oscar in a new special category just for being as good as the original moreover it intelligently portrayed the characters and the movie world in a truly sequence fashion that is in a plausible universe where situations develop and grow toy story # actually shows what one might expect a few months later from the supposed time of of events in toy story the first movie so often sequels smell like desperate movie business deals adding in ridiculous and artificial complications and dangers and emphasizing shtick that the producers think the audience loved about the original this shtick tag lines and quirky mannerisms then become fodder for billions of fast food drink cups and endless tv commercials that grind every last bit of potential pleasure that might have been gleaned from the movie into the dirt and dust so often a sequel only manages to undo the pedigree of the original not so here toy story # is a great movie with or without the first yet it also adds value and enjoyment to the first film in the future a toy story # the two flicks will definitely become a treasured boxed set of dvd to be seen and enjoyed together i gave this a ## ,10
en,1234770869,like most people i liked this better than the first one probably because it was so different similar to babe and babe # pig in the city what i found most humorous were the out takes at the end especially the dialogue between mr and mrs potato head i am still laughing about it i would only seen a bug life days before so i was still in a pixar world yes this is definitely one for all the family and a movie i am sure everyone will enjoy regardless of race religion or culture i ## saw it with my boyfriend also ## and did not have any children with us it is a happy movie and will leave you laughing till your eyes water it has simpsons like gags and spoofs i have not even seen star wars but picked up that spoof at the end but without the unnecessary sex violence or offending issues that the simpsons has this is a must see definitely the best of #### i gave it ## ## ,10
en,1234770869,how this has been rewarded monumental praise by almost everyone is beyond me i never saw this in the cinema ## years after it release i finally decided to give it a shot basically woody gets taken away buzz brings him back home everyone lives happily ever after the end that is all it really is that predictable there is absolutely nothing redeeming in this film the animation has not aged too well the voice acting is poor joan cusack is the worst offender the direction is extremely shoddy the musical number makes you want to tear your eardrums out but the absolute worst thing about this film the script calling it an affront to humanity would be an understatement there are some truly awful moments of dialogue stupid sequences that amount to nothing whatsoever some of the most unoriginal pathetic film references that have no relation to the storyline whatsoever just there for pop culture reference they are not even done with any subtlety they are just there for the sake of it it not even funny it a giant groan fest as lame after lame bits of wisdom fly from every toy mouth cheesy and dull one liners are uttered so often you really will want to kill yourself even some of the supposed adult jokes are just plain silly and should not even be there this was a painfully awful horrid boring waste of my life i do not care what anyone says this was a terrible terrible film i can honestly say that this is one of the worst films i have ever seen in my life there is nothing good i could possibly say about this at least other supposed terrible films are so bad they are good but toy story # has no redeemable qualities like michael corleone at the end of godfather part two there is no redemption for it now godfather part two that an amazing sequel check that film out once again avoid this worthless pile of vomit ,2
en,498115513,i put off seeing this movie because after seeing the trailers i just was not sure that i would enjoy it i rented it yesterday and have been kicking myself ever since because i did not rent it sooner and when i return to the video store today i will be buying it i became a fan of kevin spacey after seeing him in the usual suspects as verbal kint in fact i have enjoyed him in just about everything he has done but his performance in american beauty was amazing ensuring that the character of lester burnham once understood will not be forgotten for a very long time annette benning thora birch wes bentley ricky fitts and mena suvari all give excellent supporting performances as well i cannot recommend this movie highly enough ,9
en,498115513,this is a superb movie in each and every part if u like comedy it has it i#f u like violence it has it but the best part of the movie is its realistic feel that it gives the movie according to me has the best endings i say best because i cant remember too many movie endings where i cried and cried for almost half an hour this movie is about a common deeply depressed man who gets infatuation with his daughters friend and then starts to live his life his way and thats what starts the confusion which really messy this is a lovely movie a great movie to remember for a long time those few lines by kevin spacey between and at the end of the movie make u cry if u r a real human being,10
en,498115513,for those of you who have not yet seen american beauty some of us who have would consider you as sinners anyone and everyone should experience this movie at some point in their lifetime i would go so far as to say that it is a near perfect film in every aspect the acting from spacey and bentley is some of the most inspiring acting ever captured on film and annette bening is astonishingly perfect as the eccentric wife the movie is a plethora of beautiful sights as the director sam mendes fixates your eyes to the screen in scene after scene after scene for his first feature film i think mendes deserves at least a nomination for best director and alan ball deserves a nomination for his amazing script which all the actors bring to life with their amazing abilities and talents spacey with his wimpish impression of lester bentley as the curious and gifted ricky chris cooper as ricky militant father and bening as spacey eccentric wife as i have said before to not see this movie would be a mistake for it teaches you to look closer at the things around you and find true beauty in every aspect of your life and find things you would have otherwise passed by do not pass this by because american beauty is a timeless classic ,6
en,-1708114502,i really wanted to like this movie but this movie is so mediocre that is even hard to write a review about it what the fuss is all about is beyond me the performances are mediocre at best with the exception of tim robbins which puts out a great one starting with marcia gay harding when they get into the vampire dialog it is hard not to laugh at her then there is laura liney why she thinks that people in boston speak like southerners then there is the editing this movie just does not flow right i cannot put my finger on it other than it is all wrong then the music it reaches crescendos at the most inapropriate times and then we have a couple of blues tunes courtesy of kyle eastwood that should have been left in the trash bin i was really psyched to see this movie i had read the book and eventhough the book is not well written the basis of the story is very good and i thought it would make a great movie ohhh but leave to the screenwriters of this dog to screw that up even the ending is all wrong in the book there is a real reason about why the girl is killed in the movie they change it to a bogus reason read the spoiler at the end do yourself a favor skip this turkey this is # ## and i am being generous spoiler the reason the girl is killed is because the mute brother of her boyfriend does not want his brother to marry her and leave the house since he is very attached to him thus he kills her in the movie they make it an accidental shooting and they top it off with an accidental beating talk about extreme pc towards mute people ,5
en,-1819662859,take a look at blow director ted demme bio right here on imdb he died in #### of accidental cocaine induced thrombotic heart attack sounds like that pro cocaine stance worked out real well for ted nice going blow is ted demme pre dead by cocaine diatribe on how cocaine dealers are just good people who provide a valuable service why are we so hard on them cannot you see the big bad gubmint is ruining their lives cannot you see the big bad gubmint is ruining their families lives poor misunderstood drug dealer george jung cannot even see his daughter grow up because of the big bad gubmint this movie is absurd completely dense there a reason why drug traffickers get stiff sentences if they only got # # years there would be tons of people willing to take the risk we have laws that make it clear that if you want to be a drug trafficker you will be giving up your life if you get caught end of story that what george jung did he did it willingly ted demme wants you to weep for him no thanks ted in summary i wonder what ted demme would think if he knew ahead of time that he was glorifying the substance that killed him my guess is he would probably defiantly claim it harmless fun he found out the hard way just how wrong he was ,8
en,-1819662859,i was so taken by the strange casting for george jung parents that i could hardly concentrate rachel griffiths as johnny depp mum she five years younger than him ray liotta is only ten or twelve years older than depp so why the are both all great actors make up and costume are good and rachel does a great american accent but nothing can make her look like his mum and in any case why not cast an american actress of more or less right age i do not understand it i am not saying they did not do a great job nor that actors alway have to be a within a strict age range for every part but this seemed so odd that i thought there must be some arcane reason for the choice but i could not see it can anyone enlighten me ,5

en,-797216831,i love movies good and bad new and old with the countless and awful remakes in today world it hard to find a movie that original and unique today i rarely watch new films since i think the older ones are better imo i would not consider myself a huge jim carrey fan i like some of his movies but not all of them i had the honor of watching this great film several years ago in a college psychology class and loved it the basic idea of the film is that a man who believe what he is experiencing the real world is in fact a staged tv show that has been going on for years and has no idea about it the film itself is unique because to my knowledge nothing like this has been done before until edtv but that was different the movie itself brings up an interesting point is everything that we do in life just part of some gran scheme and somebody is watching out lives this film also has a quote that i would like to point out we accept the reality of the world with which we are presented this quote itself imo sums up the entire film we do not question the reality that exists as we see it we accept it but how do we know it real how do we know it not some person dream and that once they wake up we die we do not know that nobody knows we just accept it and deal with it truman does not question at first the world he is in little by little he questions the system and overall learns about his wolrd that he lives in if you have not seen this film then i would strong suggest you watch it especially those who have psychology background ,9
en,-797216831,hi reading movies beneath the screenplay is what i like doing rather watching what was put on screen i like guessing why was that something put on screen that way as i saw this movie it did give me an insight of myself i mean the sight to look at life when you prevent yourself from exploring to just be assure tat something was somewhere waiting fro us but not actually doing things to reach the destination and get the bingo but yes this concept this movie has given me sight to view world as a programmed one and nobody but only one self can change things from getting programmed also when i read the details of this movie i loved giving a second thought to each detail which was actually origin of world class theories life is programmed or do we make it programmed for ourselves huh its yet to all of us to decide the part that i liked about the movie was when christof talks to slyvia about truman how he never stopped truman but it was his fear and his lack of confidence to explore that made him stuck to the show and what he called as programmed life also the part where marlon speaks to truman is excellently shot very unpredictable which takes one emotion and sympathy fro truman to par hey but the concluding part in fact the last line by truman you never had camera in my head brings out a great controversy too good and a must watch movie,10
en,-797216831,in #### the truman show was overlooked for a best picture nomination as well as a best actor nomination for jim carrey but psycho the classic alfred hitchcock film was also overlooked for a best picture nomination as well as a best actor nomination for anthony perkins the point is psycho was the only film from #### that people really remember no one remembers that the apartment won best picture that year and i believe that in years to come the truman show will be the most remembered film of #### the truman show is a great drama that tells the story of a man whose entire life has been filmed on camera and broadcast as a ## hour a day show of which has millions of viewers addicted what makes this film most memorable is the direction by peter weir he turns it into a film that is at times funny but then quickly becomes sad because you feel truman deserves an uncontrolled environment the cast is perfect noah emmerich plays truman seemingly best friend who is a slave to whatever the shows creator tells him to do to keep truman from thinking of traveling laura linney who is finally beginning to get the attention she deserves plays truman wife who tries to control truman by telling him of his family obligation ed harris portrays christof the creator of the show he cares for truman but honestly believes that truman will be much happier in his world than in the actual world ed harris portrayal of the controling christof is brilliant originally the producers of the truman show wanted dennis hopper as christof but hopper turned it down i think harris is a much greater actor and gives christof more of a caring side finally their is jim carrey whose fantastic acting abilities will probably be overlooked for years because he is stil thought of as a comedian only he plays truman as he goes through the difficult days of understanding who he really is to everybody and that his world actually revolves around him the truman show will be remembered because of how unique it is as compared to any other film of the nineties it is unconventional and in our computer age seems like something that could actually happen ,7
en,-591439420,long before scream and the blair witch project there was another type of horror film hitchcock the birds was one such film through suspense and mystery the birds leaves the viewer terrified one of the greatest devices hitchcock utilised was to not tell the viewer what the problems were they are simply presented for the audience to react no one can explain at first why giant flocks of birds are flying around madly it is left to the audience to piece together the story and a good mystery it is too for some reason birds of all kinds are flying around terrorizing everything and everyone in sight perhaps the mysterious stranger in town could explain the happenings but as with all hitchcock things are not always what they seem the scenes involving birds were incredibly ahead of their time even today in this age of computers and special effects this film still matches up and also contains an overwhelming simplicity which is sometimes lost today real birds fake birds and brilliant camera work combine to provide very dark imagery the lack of score gives the film a scary silence and helps to accentuate the spine chilling calls of the flocks of birds the film also relies on the feats of nature the ability of the birds to haunt people with their incredible grouping together overall the birds is a mastery of cinema made by a master of his craft interestingly the film represents a deviation from hitchcock normal stories the mystery of human behaviour is replaced by the mystery of animal behaviour either way you will never look at a flock of birds in the same way ,9
en,-591439420,i finally bought a copy of alfred hitchcock undeniably outstanding killer animal fright film masterpiece on dvd and rewatched it although i have viewed it many times the birds still managed to creep me out and make my hair stand on end as i saw it yet again i think this alone serves a sterling testament to just what a remarkably strong and scary movie the birds truly is hitchcock extremely meticulous and thus thoroughly believable evocation of a pedestrian everyday mundane world populated by ordinary yet engaging and interesting true to life characters going about their usual business that violently disrupted by the savage shocking and inexplicable hostile attacks by every kind of bird qualifies as his major artistic triumph here there a conviction and plausibility evident in this film which makes it quite powerful and frightening in comparable measure moreover the performances by the top rate cast are uniformly outstanding tippi hedren in her delightful film debut the ever rugged and appealing rod taylor jessica tandy and a very young veronica cartwright are all splendid the inspired use of natural sound and conspicuous absence of a standard score is brilliantly effective the bird attack sequences are stunningly harrowing and horrifying the climactic night long siege on the house is an absolute tour de force of nerve wracking terror and tension and the amazingly convincing special effects remain impressive to this very day albert whitlock extraordinary matte paintings are simply spectacular fantastic chillingly ambiguous ending too if you have not seen this one in some time i strongly advise that you watch it again i am absolutely certain it will still get under your skin as well ,10
en,-591439420,this movie has no plot no story no point it like a modern day blockbuster that all show and no substance the entire story can be summed up in one sentence an unrealistically spoiled rich brat of a woman follows a man to his hometown which then proceeds to be attacked by birds that suddenly and for no reason turn on people that it no further development this plot is so stupid that neither hitchcock nor the writers bothered to come up with any reason or explanation as to why how the birds sudden super intelligence and organized hatred of humans why not be creative and argue that let say a virus causes the birds to crave human flesh all we are given is a drawn out series of pointless unexplained meaningless bird attacks on characters that we know nothing about and do not care about instead of plot development we get cool camera angles and scare tactics which by the way fall flat because without a score even the potentially frightening scenes are simply blas how could hitchcock not use music for effect after the success of psycho shower scene on top of all this hitchcock used paintings and blue screens throughout the entire movie because he hated shooting on location it shows the birds in my opinion is dare i say like its director a fake ,3
en,-164439097,i do not think there is much of a point of telling you that this movie is good a seemingly endless amount of positive reviews speaks for itself the movie surpassed ###m in box office revenues however perhaps we all got a little carried away in our communal cheering this movie is not without sins i continue to lack understanding for the argument that action movies do not have to adhere to realism i do not see the need for the sacrifice towards the end of the movie i lost count how many times this flick broke the laws of physics and i felt it did not have to according to this film being encased in a ball of wooden branches makes you survive a crash come on sometimes one is able to suspend disbelief but sometimes the violation of truth pulls you right out of the movie suddenly you are just an ape wearing #d glasses and starring at a large screen the other issue with the movie is a number of movie clich s maybe this says more about the number of movies we the public have been spoiled with over the years but throughout this film i saw scenes from star wars lord of the rings and serenity sometimes either during or shortly after such a clich the movie would acknowledge it with a joke or a little twist but if it is so self aware then why did it not avoid such scenes in the first place i mean here was the one chance to be different the movie has a talking raccoon in it and yet the makers still decided to stick to formula i do not get it the plot resembles serenity quite a bit a crew of rogues with a spaceship who do not all like one another are thrown by fate into a situation that eventually turns them into heroes and i am sure serenity probably took it from somewhere else again come up with some new stuff people another issue is that some characters change their motivations mid movie without there being a discernible character arc justifying the change the main male protagonist is portrayed as a scoundrel for the first ## of the movie and then suddenly he is convincing others to be altruistic including those who were already established to be more so than him that felt forced and contrived like the makers remembered that they had to wrap this movie up so they started cutting corners in fact with the story containing so many different characters and motivations this movie really could have used another ## minutes or so of screen time the backstory is explained in about ## seconds and if you did not pay attention too bad here a bad guy he looks evil moving on as already mentioned the movie is good the visuals are pretty it manages to be funny which often does not work out in action movies but it is unfortunate that it feels the need to trod in formula i hope that next time in the inevitable sequel gunn just takes a left and does not look back ,8

en,676132296,having read the novel interview with the vampire by the spectacular anne rice before searching out the film and watching it i have to admit that i was a little sceptical over the choice of actors as i had thoroughly enjoyed the unique character lestat de lioncourt when written down on paper i had already considered the difficulty that the director might have had to face when casting someone for the part i had not seen any of tom cruise films before this however i was completely aware of his expert acting skills but this did not stop me from doubting his performance as the illustrious brat prince lestat has such energy as a character a wicked demeanour and sarcastic nature but somehow one can not help falling for him how would an actor such as cruise carry off such a deep role louis de pointe du lac is the miserable and weak fledgling of the vampire lestat and is said to be the most human of all vampires his mortal pitying self hating attitude was another profile that i was unsure would be carried out to its full potential however i doubted brad pitt less than i had tom cruise i knew that pitt soft voice and strong appearance would fit snugly into louis character already aware that anne rice had written the screenplay herself i was ready to accept anything that differed from the book a little more romance was added to the film with the death of louis child and wife in the book it had been the death of his brother that had caused him to withdraw into himself and i was willing to accept this as a much more sensitive side to the story from the moment that brad pitt appeared on the screen i had fallen for his portrayal of louis he had everything about him to a tee even the way in which he held himself in which he looked about his surroundings and treated other people were completely accurate i had to bite my lip and apologise profusely for my doubting his performance and to add to my complete awe and satisfaction i had already fallen for the lestat that i saw before me on the television screen i laughed at his sarcasm his mood swings happiness and the way in which cruise portrayed lestat high maintenance attitude to watch cruise on the screen was as much fun as reading about lestat in the novel all of the characters that anne rice has come up with throughout the vampire chronicles keep within themselves something that would be a challenge when put onto the big screen however claudia the young vampiress belonging to louis and lestat meant the involvement of a child actor a side to film that is rarely explored kirsten dunst was chosen to play this part and at the age of twelve only two years younger than myself when i watched the film she carried off the part with maturity and as much understanding as was possible the only character with whom i was not impressed was that of armand whilst antonio banderas acted superbly the character had been cast too old armand was made at roughly the age of ## i believe and the age that they had worked him into the screenplay at seemed much older than that he was much darker than i had ever imagined the character would be and seemed less careless than that of the fun loving red head russian that i had read of whilst the last paragraph could be construed as the wishful thinking of a huge anne rice fan i believe in as much accuracy as possible when it comes to film adaptations and am sure that the pure immortality and beauty of vampires might have been displayed to a much further degree if armand had been cast with just a little more thought overall this film was positively fantastic it was bright and colourful dark and mysterious gruesome and terrible this film was full of its own magic and it left in my mind the enticing beauty of immortality the seductiveness of the way in which a louis and lestat viewed the world and the timeless story of the vampire from the ideas of a truly inspirational woman anne rice ,9
en,676132296,vampires have always been a welcome subject for hollywood it has inspired many producers writers and directors but not everyone of them has done a very good job with it some of these movies were not exactly good or very believable making it hard for the others to find an interested public but if you are interested in the subject and you want to see a good movie about it than i can definitely recommend this one the title of this movie interview with the vampire the vampire chronicles already reveals a lot about what you can expect from it it tells the story of a young journalist in san fransisco at the present day who follows a man through the streets and ends up in an anonymous room with him when the journalist starts to interview the man the stranger tells him that he is a vampire being over ### years old the journalist does not believe him but after the man proves it true he tells his story he once was a plantation owner outside new orleans in #### his wife died when giving birth to his child and he had lost all will to live when a vampire named lestat offered him the chance to become a vampire himself he accepted but soon realized that life as a vampire is not all that great either then he met a little girl claudia who influenced and changed the rest of his eternal life next to a good story you will also get some nice performances from the top cast that played in this movie tom cruise brad pitt antonio banderas all did a very nice job each portraying a vampire with an entirely different nature but it was the young kirsten dunst who surprised me the most even though she was only ## at the time she already showed what a good actress she once would be all in all this is a movie that will be loved by all the fans of vampire movies but even when you are not too much a fan of this movie i think this has plenty of good things to offer think for instance of the decors the clothing the story and the acting it all works very well together and that why i give this movie a # # ## ,7
en,676132296,great sets and equally impressive costumes fill this lurid and dark vampire tale anne rice adapts her best selling #### novel for the big screen the story of depraved love lust and hunger is told to a reporter christian slater by louis brad pitt the conscience stricken protege of the unremorseful and lascivious lestat tom cruise lestat tries hard to convince louis that the blood of new orleans aristocrats is the most pleasing of all louis would rather suck the blood of rats and chickens than to take human life joining them for companionship is claudia twelve yr old kirsten dunst who favors sinking her fangs into whores and elderly women armand antonio banderas the oldest living vampire in the world lashes out his judgment of the three blood suckers it is fun watching cruise and pitt living as a couple in hopes of hiding their vampirish way of life miss dunst is absolutely great as a character that ages thirty some odd years while staying in the body of a child note cruise was not rice favorite choice to play lestat but after the finished product was said to be more than pleased moody and gruesome but a must for vampire fans ,7
en,1854737865,i cannot believe that this film is rated so highly i was shocked to see that it had been nominated for # academy awards it not the worst film i have seen this year but the acting is not great and the plot is very contrived though i tend to agree with the not too subtle political messages contained in the film that we are moving towards a police state that our crusade against illegal immigration is a bad thing that the government should not be trusted i think that these messages are inappropriately conveyed successful films even romances are successful because they allow the viewer to suspend disbelief and children of men did not do it for me it not realistic yet still highly predictable the actors do a poor job of creating a sense of character the camera work and editing are good but without a believable story line that i can identify with what is the point why bother ,3
en,1854737865,aside from the main theme of infertility this film is interesting for the bleak vision of the future it offers with shades of blade runner we see a dying world focusing upon britain with hints of an even bleaker world outside britain with references possibly to the book camp of the saints it seems that most of the rest of the world seems to want to enter britain as a relative safe haven leading to a never ending stream of unwanted illegal immigrants the tide of which is combatted by an extreme populist new labour style department of homeland security the resistance are portrayed as a kind of far left worker revolutionary underground possibly even more brutal than the government with militant islam hovering ever present ready to take over if either the government or resistance should fail and with terrorist bombs going off all over one of the most uncomfortable premises resulting from all this is does it pander to current far right fears today of uncontrolled mass immigration and what britain might look like be like in the quite near future i e a society in chaos and at war with itself overall i found the central theme a little too simplistic but the style excellent i would recommend you see for yourself ,6
en,1854737865,if i had to sum up children of men in one word it would be flat i liked an awful lot of things in this movie post apocalyptic is probably my favourite genre michael caine is a revelation the quintessential british hero a podgy guy in an armchair wearing a cardigan i shed tears when theo escorts kee and her baby down the stairs in a war zone the baby cries causing a lull in the fighting julianne moore and clive owen excel in their roles the production design is spot on based on the theme only britain could be this crap the greenpeace guantanomo tate modern satirical moments were slightly annoying but not intrusive so why did i not get more from this film i can only guess that it failed to live up to my expectations i had heard so much about this film the trailer looked fantastic but theo journey was less than compelling perhaps it was too much exposition michael caine rendering of the story of theo son demise felt a bit clumsy the turning point for theo is when kee tells him she believes he is the only one she should trust but this key moment is pitched low key it is a good film but it could have been great in sum a bit of a missed opportunity ,6

en,618285518,this film went through hell on its way to the screen it was fondled butchered divorced and remarried sunk then revived along the way the story evolved from a one story to several only loosely connected as the studio tried to cover all bases scott hired on basically to keep working its one of his lesser projects like hannibal where he follows the script fed by others but still he has a cinematic style that makes this worth watching if you love visual poetry in fact you can watch this with no sound whatever and possibly enjoy it more that because scott designs his shots and shaves his editing so that almost each shot anticipates the next its unique in modern film making and when he goes this style will probably die gladiator was the height of this and crowe understands what he has to do to feed it he not there much but the sequence where the raid on the drug lab is so in the future it will be a film school staple for decades washington does not get this end of film making he was inherited from an earlier incarnation of the film so instead of being inside the film he placed outside he not the story but what the story uses to tell itself its a subtle distinction and washington cluelessness as an actor is used against him but it makes the thing a bit more coherent to consider his character as simply shaped by the forces around him washington has such a narrow range i could not help compare this to spike lee picture spike goes for the story as it appears in the actors he discovers it and captures it in bits he does not compose a movie its coherence comes from found characters so his pictures have no cinematic soul and give the illusion of finding reality that can work when he actually finds life which is rare he did not in x so the choppy nature of that arc stands in contrast to the energetic action of time this has scott also likes to designate watchers even if not written in the script see how he manages to photograph the two wives in such a way that they are internal surrogates for us the one thing that annoys is those labels to tell us where were we are thailand brooklyn fort bragg and so on this is just cinematic laziness scott could easily have shown us where we were and in fact does some of the time studios again i suppose yes it references films of the period specifically gangster and blaxsploitation but that almost trite by now ted evaluation # of # has some interesting elements ,6
en,-1997188143,the most over rated film in the history of cinema a hideously contrived illogical unrealistic portrayal of a nation and peoples whose lives are steeped in poverty made for the consumption and entertainment of the gluttonous morbidity upon which westernised base morals gorge their stupified mindsets the first hour is engaging fast paced and brilliantly acted by the children unfortunately it is done in the manner of a hollywood action movie leaving the unpleasant after taste to those with any sense of discernment that subsistence and poverty are somehow fun and exciting however the emotional bonds between the characters are well defined and at times moving as they grow up these bonds remain and the older brother acts as a father figure to his brother and the girl it is at this point the plot falls apart as he gets involved in murder mayhem and the sexual abuse and enslavery of the girl for whom he has spent most of his life protecting beyond his own he turns against his brother and reinvents himself on the back of an absurd plot line involving a thuggish yet moronic mafiosa gang the unlikely love story then evolves through numerous plot holes regarding the format of the gameshow the illogical rationale of the host trying to sabotage the lumdog in his quest for the top prize the impossible logistics of the phone a friend scenario all culminating in a nauseous happy ending in which we are supposed to feel so happy for the lucky couple and view the death of the older brother as some kind of twisted victory for good over evil or love over money and yet this film is all about money consumption and the excess of success to me the only feel good ending would be for him to have lost the money but got the girl but for the greed obsessed cinema goer this would not be enough he had to have it all even if by luck not judgement as for the ridiculous dance scene at the end it was a crass embarrassing and shameful exploitation of indian culture dressed up in hollywodd schmaltz i came out feeling irritable annoyed despising everything about this travesty and the overwhelming human response which somehow is enthused and excited rather than intellectually and morally insulted by this obnoxious filth ,1

en,-93997102,what is cool about gladiator besides a whole lot of things is that it should not offend pro or anti romans there have been a number of big movies almost since the beginning of movies that put rome into the evil category this choice echoes from the popular anti imperial culture of the ##th and ##st century that favors freedom over unity and order sorry i will stop if that sounds preachy but the point is gladiator gives both sides of the argument and also shows that it is not about the bad and the good sides but rather the bad and the good in the individuals gladiator is not the most historically accurate film after all they put a whole lot of story conveniently into the events for which there are very few sources for reference and of course the armor is not going to be perfectly accurate and of course everything is pumped up but it actually does a great deal right and looks genuine the politics get smart toward the middle of the film this film has depth though it is not hard to understand disguised under all the pomp and depth there is hidden a fairly typical formula for an action movie with a good and a bad guy a family member in danger a personal loss a cheesy honor speech and of course a mano a mano fight but it is hidden and packaged very well joaquin phoenix as commodus is not the protagonist but is arguably the main character of the film the evil in his character is so refined deep believable and even relatable the cowardice is palpable he feels like a complex character that creates a good contrast to russel crowe gladiator the simpleton soldier with his honor love and anger issues oliver reed as the gladiator owner was also really good and expressive the camera work is excellent the busy sets are filled with good lighting and shots are properly populated with good atmosphere from all the various fires mist and snow computer generated effects are unfortunately used quite a bit as the makers would have had a hard time showing the roman scale without it and yes some of these effects look dated but those shots are not shown for long and overall it works the soundtrack composed by hans zimmer is actually not the best if you listen to it on its own but works really well in this movie especially in battles it brings the necessary gravity to everything speaking of listening to the soundtrack on its own do try the might of rome when visiting a large city awesome lisa gerrard brought her voice which is a great recognizable emotional deep contralto though her main presence in this movie is saved for the credits the movie is totally rewatchable and in fact the second time may reveal many new nuances in the dialogue you may have missed the first time especially if you are watching the extended addition which you should as time passed after its release this movie was increasingly becoming a hype internet memes were being made from it people kept asking me to make maximus armor for a game this plebeian hype made me increasingly dislike this film by extension but the fact is that this is a very well made enjoyable movie ,9

en,-1777121287,i begin this post with a vow i will not no matter how tempting make a pun based on the title of rush to my surprise even creative writers such as bill simmons employed such a method but i will not i will rise above the appetizing pun last weekend i saw the film rush let me tell you it was a rush sorry i took the bait like many other movie lovers i had been waiting for rush to come out for quite some time it was directed by ron howard and considering his last two films were less than subpar it had to be good he was past due beyond that the trailer was a mess a good mess as i have shared before blake and i have a theory ambiguous movie trailers produce great films of course there are always exceptions but i believe there are a lot of good examples the next film i believe will fit this bill is the counselor watch the trailer you probably have no idea what the movie is about but i reckon it will be pretty darn good i felt similarly about rush i knew it was about racing and philandering but not much else rush had a rudimentary story there was nothing too complex about it in many circumstances that would be considering a shortcoming but excellent acting and precise storytelling made the basic plot impressive as with most racing movies days of thunder talladega nights this film was about a rivalry and a traumatic accident james hunt chris hemsworth is a handsome english free spirit who enjoys his booze and women willing to risk his life he often makes moves on the track others would not dream of progressing him through the ranks of professional racing then there is niki lauda daniel bruhl lauda is a calculating cold individual who views racing as a mathematical equation despite the threat of losing the right to the family fortune lauda becomes a racer hunt and lauda first meet in formula # racing two steps below formula # their personalities clash hunt pulls a risky move winning him the race and knocking lauda out lauda develops animosity despite his initial failure in formula # lauda takes out a personal loan and buys his way into formula # lauda excels and hunt eventually follows suit their rivalry ripens in formula # until lauda gets in a fiery wreck because of tumultuous weather conditions lauda wanted to cancel the race however hunt swayed the other drivers to vote to race despite the less than ideal weather conditions throughout lauda recovery hunt gains formidable ground in the standings while developing an admiration for niki ultimately the season comes down to the last race hunt is still three points behind lauda but can secure a world championship with a top # finish so long as niki receives zero battle wounds and all lauda participates in the final race while another torrential downpour ensues after a couple laps however niki pulls into the pit and decides he is finished the film suggests it was for the love of his wife in dramatic fashion hunt finishes third and secures the world championship months later hunt and lauda run into each other at an airport hunt tells niki that he has no reason to race anymore since he has reached the top but lauda implores hunt to stay in racing the rest of the film includes informational text over actual photographs of james hunt and niki lauda if you want some actual historical context look here one may hear this tale and decide that it was not very original and or compelling normally i would agree with that sentiment i am all for fresh perspectives and stories that have not been told before yet no matter how much rush reminded me of other tales it was compelling many racing movies appeal to a certain type of moviegoer the transformers # super fan type they are a special breed not in it for the story line or the character development but for the explosions and over the top sixty minute ultimate battle scenes they are the type of people that prefer the episodes i ii and iii of star wars just despicable if you ask me rush amazingly was able to be a movie both for the aforementioned individuals and those with a more sophisticated palate wow i hope i do not sound too much like a snob ron howard did an amazing thing he took a very basic story and created a fascinating drama intertwined with titillating race sequences he made an old story appear crisp obviously this was not without some help another reason you should definitely check out rush is because of the acting i had seen chris hemsworth in a few roles before rush but none of which hinted that he was capable of the performance he displayed on more than one occasion i thought that this could be a breakthrough role for the young actor it is not as promising when you look at what films are on deck for him however he has the second thor movie the avengers age of ultron and snow white and the huntsman # do not get me wrong thor and the avengers were decent movies they are just not roles that generate acclaim for being a great actor there is always the chance he will break from his current mold soon though rush was a taste of that alongside hemsworth was daniel br hl overall rush was a fun film it masterfully balanced many different aspects of cinema in one production it was a great example of how to execute storytelling i would definitely see this again though i would want to make sure i had a large screen television and surround sound #

en,-1720485409,ok where to begin with this movie thinking of dc previous release catwoman the future of dc film was looking slim but then was saved by the dark knight or rather christopher nolan and his vision of one of the best comic book characters to ever be created batman a version that is more superior to tim burton version and definitely more superior to joel schumacher version one of the things that stands out in this movie for me is when christian bale is in the bat suit he becomes a different person his voice the way how he moves it all changes and after the ending how could i not be excited gordon unveiling the bat light to the bat and then giving him the calling card of another criminal which happens to be a jokers card it will also be interesting to see what happens in two years time as there is the batman sequel and spidey # scheduled for the same year what a great time it is turning out to be for us comic book nuts roll on ####,10
en,-1720485409,the other feature films called batman are to this movie what a saturday morning abc family show is to the godfather a very powerful superbly directed movie with a treasure trove of name actors that make it all the more enjoyable and the new kids in the movie christian and katie deliver solid performances that are definitely not the bubble gum pap we have been served up in the other batmans if only these two could have starred in star wars rather than the boring wooden hayden and natalie it a bit on the long side but i cannot honestly say there were more than a few minutes that should have been left on the cutting room floor if your senses can take it sit close to the screen in a new theater with a really good sound system it will rattle you in more ways than one ,10
en,-1720485409,i loved how all of the reasons for having the gadgets were explained with just enough detail so that they did not take over the film and leave you bored christian bale has to be the best batman yet he fit into the role with apparent ease and made it his own great role for katie holmes good to see her in a more mature role michael cane fit comfortably into the role of alfred the bad guys in this film were actually bad instead of just being there for comic relief the ending left it open enough for another movie but also it could easily just be linked onto the original michael keaton film with jack nicolson in it dark yet informative without being boring thoroughly enjoyable to watch ,10
en,-1720485409,this movie perfectly displays the origin of bruce wayne on his journey to becoming the batman from the moment his parents are killed what i really like about this movie his how it shows bruce relationship with bats from the first time he saw them in the cave he fell into bruce is shown to be afraid and almost mesmerized by the tiny furry animals he eventually accepts his co existence with bats when he re vists the cave and calmly lets bats swarm around him in some scenes he treats bats as his allies this relationship with bats is displayed throughout the entire trilogy and is what makes christopher nolan vision of batman stand out after the movie establishes bruce origin it brilliantly and accurately shows bruce path to becoming batman from him forging batarangs to the creation of the batsuit to the first time he busts criminals this movie also contains the first appearance of import batman gotham city related characters those being alfred pennyworth lucius fox and commissioner gordon each one of these characters are displayed perfectly and each have the perfect actors for their roles of course in most superhero movies the hero is not paired against casual city criminals they eventually are given a challenge when they are paired against the antagonist bruce does have experience from his encounters with the league of shadows he is not quite ready to take on a criminal cancer within the depths of gotham city the notorious scarecrow the twisted villainous character gives batman the true test of fear overall christopher nolan sets his batman trilogy on the right path with this movie everything about this movie appeals to batman fans or superhero fans in general everything about the movie is great christian bale takes on the role of batman and does one of the best jobs as the character to this day the movie accurately captures the character scarecrow and tops it off with the league of shadows and ra al ghul this movie is absolutely perfect every dc fan should see it ## ##,10
en,-1720485409,i read in the paper that this was a re invention of batman movies and they were right there was a dark side too it but it was not the gruesome darkness that you find in the tim burton batman movies the villains were more real and did not have the fake and exotic costumes like the other batman movies i still really like the riddle and two face in fact everything look more real the city of gothom looked more like a city and not a drawing from a comic book i also like that you got to know bruce wayne parents a little more then any of the other batman movies all the actors were great christian bale is this great actor who has been hidden for so long he played the brooding and self searching bruce wayne so well and he is a great billionaire playboy very cute there was not much humor but the few funny bits were very cute and funny just enough to relieve a little tension i plan on seeing this movie again in the theater i love the feeling of walking out of the theater knowing you just saw a great movie ,10
en,396683751,i watched this movie in theaters twice i own the movie now and still can never watch it enough this is one of the best of steve kings movie michael duncan as john coffey is exceptional sad that michael duncan is no longer with us but he was a great actor tom hanks did a great part also mr jingles the mouse is great how did they get a mouse to do all that this movie is never boring and is never dull and it certainly did not feel three hours long lets just say if you have never watched this movie you really need to it is one of the best ,10
en,396683751,this movie had the most one dimensional black and white totally uninteresting group of characters i have seen in a long time hanks and his buddies were the good guys right from the start these guys were the most decent upstanding and honest death row prison guards you can ever possibly meet they did not have a single ounce of badness in them man if you were ever in prison these are the guys you would want as your guards in contrast percy and wild bill were the exact opposites these guys were evil to the bone not an ounce of goodness in them percy was cruel and wicked almost to the point of absurdity there were none of the blurred lines between good and evil that you get in real life everyone was either totally good or totally evil with no in between what is really funny is that the other prisoners the death row inmates that is were presented as being totally good i guess they must have been wrongly convicted as well either that or the people they murdered were evil and deserved to die anyway unfortunately the movie does not enlighten us on their past none of the characters had any real depth to them we never learned anything about any of them other than this guy is good this guy bad this guy also bad but these other guys are all good and this last guy good but he about to get fried man is not that sad there was no real growth or change in the characters the only thing that changed was their attitude toward coffey i really do not mind movies going three hours long if they have the substance to sustain it but this movie did not in fact when i stop to think of it not a whole lot actually happened of course there were the endless scenes with the mouse and what was the whole point of that which seemed to go on forever i also thought the scenes with dabbs greer as the older paul edgecomb should have been cut they really did not add much extra to the film other than to tell us as if we did not already know that it just so sad that they killed coffey they also made the ending drag on forever i will give the movie credit for not backing down from the capital punishment issue it does not hold anything back in the execution scenes some of them are very hard to watch and they should be this is death row after all my overall rating for the movie is not good any time you make a movie three hours long you are walking a fine line the extra time can make a really good movie seem like a classic however it can also make a very average movie which this is seem very tedious of the best picture nominees for ## this was easily the worst # ## ,4
en,396683751,well i must say that i was very disappointed with this one it s one of the worst stephen king movies the questions i asked myself that you never got an answer to was who is the black man is he god or something else why did he sit there with the two little sisters where did he come from and that kind of stuff but you never got the answer and that is strange cause you usually get answers in stephen king movies so that was a big disappointment otherwise it was kinda boring nothing really funny never happened just like the same thing over and over but the ending made it a bit better though give it like a # # ##,6
en,-597810200,one of the best tom hanks movies the innocence of the main character makes amazing movie from the beginning the way he transforms the lives of people is simply incredible i loved it from the first time i saw him the lessons it conveys are very important never give up especially the love and friendship life is really bumpy with ups and downs but we have to hold on to what makes us happy and never let go otherwise we lose our identity i loved it if you have not seen do not know what you are waiting it will be one of the best films i have seen the setting the actors the script are five star the film teaches us very important life lessons and we must learn from them and do not let go next i will make you think about what have you done but more importantly will help you make choices in the future i just loved it tom hanks is to be congratulated for fantastic character that is ,8
en,-597810200,forrest gump is a film that portrays the life of forrest gump through flashbacks and voice over narration we meet forrest gump a slow man perfectly portrayed by tom hanks at the beginning of the film when he introduces himself to the first person who sits next to him on a bench at a bus stop it is from this point that we begin the journey of his life starting with his philosophical mother mrs gump played by sally fields and his unfortunate need for leg braces from here forrest takes the bus to school for the first time and we are introduced to his childhood friend and love at first sight jenny curran played by robin wright in college jenny and forrest go their separate ways throughout forrest gump life he experiences and causes many historical moments such as inspiring elvis presley dance moves meeting multiple presidents and uncovering the watergate scandal although these are monumental experiences it seems he is somehow always drawn back to jenny in the film they are brought back together several times a significant time being when forrest loses his mother and jenny stays with him the morning after their night together she once again leaves him in the end we are brought back to forrest gump the narrator in present day looking for jenny in response to a letter she sent him the result of their one night together left them with a son forrest played by haley joel osment jenny and forrest gump are finally united and get married before she dies of an unknown virus the film ends perfectly on a scene much like the one where forrest first met jenny but with little forrest getting on the bus for school for his very first time the theme of this film seems to be torn between drama and comedy however the main focus is the endurance and true love that forrest has for jenny although he is always there for her when she needs him she always ends up leaving him and going her own way this fact does not seem to deter his love for her and every time she comes back into his life he embraces it a scene that reinforces this unbreakable love that forrest has for jenny is when they are reunited again in washington they are having a conversation before jenny leaves him once again which she has done multiple times before this scene even though she is preparing to leave him again forrest gives her his medal of honor and tells her that the reason he is good to her is because she is his girl and then she was gone from his life again another film that is quite a different story but relates to the endurance of true love is the notebook in this film a young man tries his hardest to be with a young woman before they are separated years later they are brought back together but she is with another man when they finally end up with one another she ends up with alzheimer he spends the remaining days of their lives together reading to her and trying to bring her back to him music has a way of affecting our emotional response to a film in forrest gump the use of music is very effective especially when changing scenes when jenny hitches a ride with a stranger instead of staying with forrest the musical score is soft and almost sad however the musical score playing when they see each other again in washington is blissful and romantic another technique used in this film is voice over narration this narration done by forrest emphasizes his thoughts and feelings of jenny even though she is absent from a majority of the film the use of this narration conveys his slow point of view on his life and the things that happened in it but also speeds the passage of time along the film itself is already a little longer than necessary so voice over used for narration is important in moving the film along at a good pace but creating an impact on his way of thinking overall this film holds your interest in its creativity and alterations of historical events the intermittent connection of forrest and jenny lives surpasses decades in the end even though jenny has an unknown virus forrest marries her and takes care of her until death do they part this ultimately paints the picture of the true love that forrest had for jenny and how it endured the test of time ,9
en,-597810200,i do not know how to describe how a perfect movie is but forrest gump sure can it gives you all the feelings a film can it delivers everything you ever wanted from a film the perfect heroine the perfect main character the perfect ending the perfect punch line and forrest gump himself is a character drawn as to be a man with the most integration you will ever meet inspiring if i could shed a tear i would happily give it to this film as you know the film is about the life of forrest gump he starts his story as a story teller telling his own life to random people at a bench in somewhere we are yet to know the film does not waste it time in his past as i would fear to make me bored quickly we go through the many live story a man can get entertaining as well as thrilling in a way as we go through all that the set goes through the present time of forrest gump where it becomes so touchy you would not expect so a brilliant performance from tom hanks too a great performance from the actor of lieutenant dan gary sinise as i have not seen him in many but all favorites but this tops them all sinise gains my respect easily comes to the top of my favorite movie of all time brilliant ## ##,10
en,134565356, i did not kill my wife i do not care fantastic and gripping thriller i have not seen the series but i have heard it inspired twin peaks to an extent so i will probably check it out sometime but this film lives up to it reputation as a great thriller harrison ford plays richard kimble a respected doctor who is accused for the brutal murder of his wife his only argument is that he stumbled upon his murdered wife and a one armed man whom he fought with this does not hold up in court and all the evidence is against him so he sentenced to be executed and sent on the bus out of chicago fortunately for him the bus crashes allowing him to escape and from then on it a game of cat and mouse as he is pursued tooth and nail by a cop tommy lee jones excellent eventually kimble finds himself back in chicago in a hunt for evidence to clear his name while being pursued by the cops harrison ford is excellent and convincing as the disgraced doctor hanging on by his fingernails and tommy lee jones is funny and likable as the cop pursuing him the hunt and the unfolding conspiracy keeps you gripped throughout and the set pieces can be quite awesome like a massive dam kimble finds himself testing his faith with the supporting cast are all good notably andreas katsulas commander tomalak in star trek tng equally sinister here and jeroen krabbe i am not sure if the film was making any deliberate stabs at corporate corruption or big pharma or just using that as a story element but it works the film is an excellent mystery and an excellent action thriller highly recommended ,10
en,134565356,this movie is the typical plot of a man who is innocent and is then wrongfully charged with murder harrison ford plays this man a doctor who supposedly kills his wife right away the movie sets it up where you really care for ford and you want his justice served the cops are of course dumber than dumb ford just shaves his beard and dyes his hair and can walk around conducting his own investigation while the movie is well done given the above scenario there came a point where i thought omg how much longer can this plot line be played out we all know what is going to happen in the end anyways it seem to me that better editing shortening would have made this movie much better as it is it takes too long to wrap up about # #rds the way through i got bored ,6

en,-147952656,i had once started reading the book when i was in sixth grade the beginning was pretty boring so i could not go on when i heard the movie was coming out i went ahead and read the rest of it i finished it about three weeks before the movie came out and i must say i was pleased that i went ahead and read the four books i went to see the movie about a week after it came out and it was also very pleasing i liked the fact that chris colombus directed instead of spielberg all the characters were very well acted the kids were all brilliant especially emma watson and rupert grint all the teachers were well portrayed especially snape and they also did a great job with my favorite character from the book hagrid played by robbie coltrane the visual effects were well created i think my favorite scene is the quidditch game i like all the shots they took from the air and the scoring of the film was the best thing in the movie nevertheless they missed out some parts of the book that were important for example harry was pretty confident in calling voldemort by his name and in the book he always says vol i mean you know who hermione also says voldemort name once and according to the book she was afraid of it as well they also left out the whole story with norbert the dragon and they do not show the reaction of the students for the ### points that harry and his friends lost apart from those little things left out this was a very good movie and i do not understand all of the bad publicity they are throwing to it i am looking forward to seeing the chamber of secrets # ## ,9
en,-155461643,if you know anything about the movies of david fincher you know they are different strange and dark with twist as he gives clues and then twist happen that you may or may not expect with this latest gone girl which is based on a best selling novel it a good suspense mystery tease the acting and chemistry is top notch with ben affleck and rosamund pike as married couple nick and amy it seems as if they are the power couple as they have money love and success from their writing jobs as both are educated with wit and books still behind the scenes lies drama and hidden skeletons in the closets of both and when the # year anniversary hits amy vanishes from their home and strange clues are left behind and then the hype and drama builds thru the police and media around the case as people think that nick killed and did away with his wife fincher does a good job of drawing the film out with discovery and drama build up as it leads to more tension and much of the film is told thru flashback only this picture takes a twist that you may or may not like i do not want to reveal to much it proves that life and blood is thicker than water and also that people are deviant and life is complex and strange with love and desire ,8
en,-155461643,a woman has suddenly gone and it is uncertain whether she was murdered or kidnapped by stranger people suspect that her husband kills her but he firmly insists his innocence the truth is revealed in the end but until then you will be continuing puzzled what is great about this movie is that it includes a few elements of movie genre love mystery and suspense at first glance it looks really like an authentic mystery with the police who are struggling to solve the unaccountable case therefore you will also tackle the issue presuming the possibility of her death and if so guessing who is the criminal in the way you do when you watch the mystery drama however you finally notice that a gone girl who is supposed to be a pitiful victim is actually cruel criminal who is not reluctant to deceive and kill people you will feel scared by her characteristic as if you will be so in a suspense drama besides you will also realize what drives her crazy is love to sum up it is really complicated story of which you can hardly name the genre and at the same time it is a well designed story as well ,9
en,-155461643,too much was said about this movie so let get to the point # granted that amy was a troubled woman we discover that when we find out how she framed her ex lover as being a rapist but there was never a profound problem in her current marriage to summon such intense action do not forget that she officially and supposedly forever killed herself as amy before she had to change the plan and she was not nobody but a successful writer from a rich family so if she was amy the maid who wanted to kill amy the maid after running away with some serious cash to re invent herself as lats say jane i would buy the story but amy the successful writer from a rich family killing her name for a husband way inferior to her in social class physically torturing herself hitting herself on the cheek with hammer and to live in a cabin swarmed with bedbugs that just ridiculous nick appeared to be a good husband actually he never wasted her wife money as she claimed all he did was having an affair which looked pretty normal given the state of their marriage # video cameras we saw some scenes that she tried to play victim in front of the cameras but to make the scheme work she had to access the records modify them and etc pretty much something like the rising sun movie which was obviously out of the scope of her ability in this movie the movie could work beautiful without those stupid and ridiculously plotted video cameras # amy was recorded in the casino a redneck couple just robbed her a costumer in casino almost recognized her so many traces left behind could easily lead to and expose her # the ending were the worst my guess is that in original script she was supposed to get caught but david fincher decided to give it an intellectual ending and as a result the script was hastily edited and of course some holes in the plot left behind probably he wished to aim for oscars with this move which i hope he never wins ans he greatly ruined a could be great movie ,4

en,-2099423236,such an action packed film that keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire ### minutes the chestburster scenes are raw the cast was not told what was going to happen and leave most of the audience with nightmares to last a lifetime this film is what started it all i would have to say that the only downside is just that i felt that there could have been more aliens than there were i guess it would be easy to say that it left us with many unanswered questions that would later be answered in one or more of the sequels however a bulk were answered in prometheus this film left every viewer scared for there lives in their own homes thinking that a facehugger was just around the corner ,9
en,-2099423236,one verrrrrrrrry minor spoiler alien is an impressive and genuinely scarry film surprising given the films limited budget and the fact that this was only ridley scott second film unlike most sci fi monster movies alien functions as a pretty effective haunted house flick the atmosphere is flawlessly maintained by the director and the cast alike while we only really get brief glimpses at the alien itself we get a good enough look at it for it to be burned in our brains great performances all around particularly by weaver and holm a bit conventional at times let split up and allow the alien to kill us off one by one but still a good way to kill two hours # ##,9
en,-2099423236,i would like to say this the alien franchise rocks i love every one of them hopefully we see a new alien movie like yesterday ridley scott did his thing directing this wonderful movie dan o bannon with the awesome screenplay and of course must thank sigourney weaver for her outstanding job acting if you have not seen or heard about this movie and franchise you should be shipped to planet not cool if you love watching acid spitting into humans face and body parts melting through then this is the movie for you if you like the predator movies then of course you will love alien i love everything about this movie story screenplay directing lightning and of course the acting ,10
en,-2099423236,i read a review of this which said it was dull overrated and basically awful the reviewer preferred aliens this is a classic example of the bland film tastes of many mainly american and british audiences today this is a movie which redefined terror that pushed the limits of set design that was not afraid to make you feel physically ill at times we all know the plot by now rusty spaceship is summoned to help an abandoned planet picks up an unwanted alien passenger and the rest of the plot concerns the crews attempts to escape from it which makes it both accessible and yet unknowable expected yet still fresh if you want a dumb p c oh look we are being post modern are not we clever movie then watch most of what hollywood produced in the past decade if you want something of quality and substance watch this and it was made by an english director yes ,10
en,-2099423236,this is how a film should be made very suspenseful sci fi horror film much better than it sequels and spin offs and most of it effects still holds up today because of how they were created great build up of tension and great story i especially like the way that unease is built up even before they discover that the alien is on board the ill ease between the crew and the isolation felt by the crew even the title sequence is helps to build the suspense as it shows you just how isolated the crew are if you are an action fan however it is probably better to skip this film and skip to aliens because the only action here comes at the end when ripley tries to escape the exploding ship and it is really just a chase scene ## ## would have given it higher ,10
